"Good laptop for the money. Windows is unusable for me with default configuration (HDD, 4Gb ram). Upgrade ram as soon as you get it for better performance on dual channel memory. There is one empty ram slot and Lenovo manual says upto 12Gb total ram is supported. That is 8 GB ram can be installed in the slot. I've only added 4g. Please remember that 2Gb will be dedicated to the GPU and there's no option in bios to change this. So I had only 6Gb available ram for programs and services. It has o...",4

I had to buy kingston ddr4 8gb 2666mhz ram for Rs.2500 to actually get this laptop to work as otherwise it would utilize 80-85% ram on just opening a web browser. 8gb is the maximum additional upgrade allowed.

"First of all I got this gadget in a very low price which was a cool deal with this specifications. No doubt specs are too good but here are some pros and cons after usage of two weeks approx.

Pros:

Design is really good and keys are smooth

Storage is also good

RAM

Genuine windows 10

Genuine microsoft office

AMD ryzen 3 processor

Light weight

Big display

Sound quality is crisp at a defined point

Battery charging time is almost 3 to 3.5 hours from 0 to 100

"Got this laptop in 24000 only . Best laptop For personal nd simple work . But If you want to do heavy work then you should buy SSD RAM variant for fast performance. Which having cost of 28000 I think .
Overall good laptop
Battery backup is 2-2.5 hours if you continuously use it.",4
It's a great laptop I got it under 29k best buy for me and just add 4gb ram to it and see the magic happen it's too good,5
"Product is worth five stars for the price of 22k-24k.
Though I bought this @29k during lockdown since my old laptop crashed.
If you can wait for the price drop to 22k-24k, go for this without any second thought.
But for the price of @29k, i would recommend to go for ASUS having same specs but much better battery backup.

Pros:
1. Design is good, display is good.
2. Ryzen 3 is much better compared to i3 7th gen.
3. Comes with MS office
4. Speakers are good.

Cons:
1. Mouse touch pad is n...",4
"I am using this laptop since 1year. No complaints. Running perfectly. But it is little bit slow response. It's because the storage device is hdd which has slow read rate. When I upgraded to ssd and 8GB ram , it is performance beast. It is also capable of running games in medium settings.
Overall I will four star. Acer aspire 7 is more better than this. If we considering the budget. It is the best laptop",4
"I think this is one of the finest laptop i ever bought
Looks good , best battery backup, performance is very fast with ryzen 3 dual core, Ryzen 3 dual core is far better than Intel i5 10th gen
It will give u battery backup of around 5 hrs
Go for it guys",5
"I'm gong to brief about the Pros and Cons only.

Pros -
1. Ryzen 3 Processor

3. FHD Screen
4. Light weight
5. Windows 10 and MsOffice pre installed
6. Looks

Cons -
1. Battery backup
2. TouchPad
3. Webcam

Now on a simple note for day to day office work or students assignments, surfing its a great deal. If you are thinking of gaming then don't go for it. Else product is good.",4
"I SO HAPPY THIS IS MY FIRST LAPTOP THANKS FLIPKART GIVE ME FAST DELIVERY AND GOOD SERVICE
THERE IS NO FRAUD FROM FLIPKART YOU CAN TRUST THE FLIPKART",4
"Build Quality is Not so Good, Track-pad is decent enough for daily use.
Performance is good considering the price Thanks to Ryzen 3 3200U (Recommend to buy Variant with Ryzen 3 4000 series).
Main bottleneck for this laptop is the HDD. Because of hard disk this laptop doesn't feel snappy(AMD is not to be blamed).
I recommend Upgrading to SSD or buy a variant with SSD.
Display is very good with decent viewing angles.
4 Hours + battery life with fast charging.",5
"Honest Review

I am writing this review after using this laptop for almost 2 months. Overall quality is average unless you have upgraded RAM. I an waiting to purchase an 8GB RAM because RAM consumption is too much by the Windows App, 600MB is reserved by hardware as well. I haven't used any SSD powered laptop so I can't say buying it will speed up your performance or not but am sure with the RAM.

So when I play game (GTA IV) on this laptop. CPU usage is always around 30%-40% RAM usage is a...",4
"It's really. Value for money.
Performance wise it's good. Not to expect quick boot and fast multi tasking. But it's quite ok for daily single task activities.
Laptop is not much sturdy. Noisy keyboard and noisy mouse pad. Probe to Scratch.
180 degree display is very supportive and still not giving confident not over usage.
Though these are all not in harsh note. It's overall good product in this price point.",4
"A good laptop in the price segment .
Dont exoect it to run heavy gaming or work, it's good to go for moderate users like bwosing studying and work.",5
"Overall a good product for this price!!
Display is good.
Battery backup is around 4 hours.
Speaker clarity is awesome.... But not more loud.
Performance is better than i3 7th gen processor.
Ram upgrade is must for improving the speed of the machine.",5
"A really good product considering that it's so affordable, I recommend it to anyone who needs it for basic tasks like surfing, typing, school and office work in general.
However, I would recommend that you upgrade the RAM a 4GB upgrade would be ok, but I recommend adding another 8GB as a lot of it is taken by background processes (I was even able to play GTA V with the 8GB upgrade)
The only little problem I have aside that is the display is a little off coloured.",5
"good laptop at reasonable prices .charger size is small, but speed is not up to the mark. ok for basic college work",3
Got this 1 in offer by flipkart big billion days for just 2500....many suggestions i received in terms of low budget laptop..but i wanted to try this product...but this has led me so far aftr months of usage..it comes with great display atleast compared to other brands in this range...but rest all depends upon the user how he manages his pc. but to me its little slow in terms of opening an application but its fine manageable...overall its the most decent 1 i came accrossin this price range.,4
"Worked fine till 6-7 months after that started lagging.
Very slow performance. Battery backup is just 2 hours.
Low end pc. Motherboard got damaged in just 11 months. The new motherboard replaced by lenovo is not working properly. I think it's not good for heavy usage. The laptop is not as good as expected.",3
It's awesome laptop doing great work when u creat account first time it's take time after that it's works excellent and battery is average and I get in 25k on big billion days and it's work smoothly,5
"first of all battery backup is not good
design is good
webcam is totally poor quality
low grade plastic is used so build quality is zero
performance is also not so good it takes approx 40_50 seconds to boot after installing all the drivers
instead go for acer aspire ryzen 3 with better build quality and performance",3
"This one is good if you are looking for general usage.
Ram need to be extended for better performance.
Camera should be enhanced more , currently it is poor.
Other than this is ok for a student.",3
"It's not the best laptop I've ever used but it's certainly the best bang for buck at this price. I invested some more into the laptop (added 8gb ram, replaced hdd with ssd) and the performance shot through the roof!

I have two issues though - the display chassis is a little too flimsy (wasn't expecting much at this price anyway), and the display itself is sub-par. I had to calibrate it manually to make it bearable but all's well if ends well.

In short, you can't get anything better at this...",5
"This is my first ever purchase of laptop. I am using it for last 6 months and after that I'm reviewing the product.
1. The battery performance is medium. In power saving mode the performance is better. Upto 4 to 4.5 hours.
2. The screen sometimes become grey so clarity is medium.
3. Dolby sound system is very good.
4. The touch pad system is not upto the mark. It's better to use a mouse.
5. The build quality is also good in this price.
6. For better performance you just need to upgrade the R...",4
"This is not a student laptop, but I would like to say it's also for professionals.

I can perform following things very smoothly:

Web development with .net framework
Adobe Photoshop
Android development
Multitasking
Smooth video editing like filmora
AutoCAD
MATLAB. Etc
YouTube professionals work



Below are the issues
In short it is not a software developer or engineers laptop.
Better you look for i7 + 16 GB ram with 500ssd

-one more thing Ryzen 3 is best as compare to i3 for sure.",5
Laptop is very good performance is very good and battery performance is also nice and charging is 65 word which charge the laptop at very low time performance is super at this the price point,5
"Lenovo is preloaded with default apps which makes the performance slow. Better to disable all those apps not to run on the start up to improve performance. Even I was literally feeling like returning but being an engineer thought give few more days.. suggest Lenovo team also to reduce the preloaded apps or send the technician who comes and does the first time installation and set up. This might be useful for common man

Lookwise it is awesome
500+ mb is dedicated to for display
So we get 3.5 ...",3
"Perfect home laptop. Good graphics.
And appealing outlook. 15.1inch. and compact and wonderfull. It doesn't have the CD slot. The only disadvantage I found.

Apart from that's this is good with, teams, photoshop, Adobe premiere etc. Its awesome for those type of softwares. And its like good enaf.",4
"Got it for 24k, good for the mentioned price, don't go for it above 25k, good thing is it can be extended ram and SSD, display is decent and viewing angle is not upto the mark.",4
"Well, using it for several days and it never disappointed me so far. I was a little bit confused about AMD but then found Ryzen 3 3200U is actually better than Intel's i3 8th gen and it can compete even 10th gen in terms of clock speed.

Looks like one must update RAM since it's 4gb isn't enough for multitasking cause it's Slow and Sometimes hangs. And for further betterment one can go for SSDs(NVMe only otherwise replace the HDD)

Display is quite decent in comparison (in that price segment)...",3
"Pro
Decent product and built quality compared to price of laptop.
Two side bezel definitely look good.
R3 is great for light work ideal for office work which doesn't involve heavy software.
Most importantly it is cheaper than I3.
Keypad is great and button quality and finish is goods
Preinstalled Windows and MS office greatly reduce your installation hassle and makes it perfect for non-tech users.

Cons
It made in China.
Though it has a Graphic card it is not a gaming laptop.
Screen is brigh...",4
"Awsome laptop in affordable range!
Must good going laptop for students and basic uses!
Package is nicely.. full care has been taken..
Overall its worth it!",5
"This is a must buy laptop if you wish to get a laptop in 30k as it includes graphics too If you wish to get a laptop for normal use it is the best laptop don't go for a second think to buy this , the display and the features are ausumn

One thing you need to keep in mind is the battery it last for 2, 3 hours on heavy usage.
It sometimes hangs but after updates the laptop is working fine (it's an honest review)


I am Giving the review after using the laptop for a month",4
Laptop is Best in 27K but 4Gb Ram is not Sufficient if you are a casual user then buy it other Wise its waste of money not recommended for Gaming or Editing,4
I bought this laptop in big billion day sale. It has only 4gb ram. Better to upgrade extra 4gb. After adding extra ram it's work like charm. Battery backup is not that much good. But at this price what you expect. Sound quality is very low after enabling Dolby audio. If your budget is between 25k to 34k definitely buy this one . MS OFFICE is with life time validity. And McAfee Antivirus with 1 month of trial version,4
"This laptop is good for a student like working in ms excel,word,powerpoint and editing and checking email.this laptop only comes in 4gb ram whch is soldered to the motherboard so u can grab another 8gb of ram from flipkart so u can make it much more powerful but not good as expected.",4
"Excellent product. Early delivery by Flipkart. Good packing. No issue in operation of machine. No issue in activating preinstalled Windows 10 and MS Office 2019. Mcphy antivirus was preinstalled aswell. Overall a good purchase in INR 24490 including one year warranty. Those who are planning to buy core i3 9th generation may consider it as it's performance is no lesser than i3 8th generation and in most of the aspects of performance and several games, it leads i3 9th generation. One more USB p...",5
"The laptop is very good in terms of daily office work and study, Do not expect it to out perform the specs. It is a decent laptop which will give you enough to get going. But if you want high speeds and extreme multi tasking, then go for a better one. If Study and office work( Spreadsheets, multiple chrome windows, drive etc.) is your concern then its just fine.",5
I got this laptop in 23k in bbd sale .

This review is based on few hrs use without any more aap download pre installed windows 10 and ms office this is great but I check battery very keenly because battery is main component of laptop. Use only screen with internet for video backup is 3:30hrs . Use any task with involved processor power .

"The feel and design is pretty sleek and its genuinely light weighted. Battery performance is average but its good for office work &/or for Work from Home purpose. Biggest down side is that the speakers in this laptop is very low. Ryzen 3 vs Intel 3 was a challenge but if you are saving 2-3K with Ryzen, go for it. Overall satisfied with the product.",3

Overall a good package under rs 25k...",4
It is to good product but one problem is there its battery backap is poor,5
Average laptop. Don't expect it to be decent quick. Opens up applications after more than 30 secs. Would not recommend it for heavy or moderate use.,3
"A best laptop at this range...
It is very stylishly designed.....
Display is good....
Amd ryzen 3 and 8th gen
Mcafee is free for one month but they have mentioned 1 year.....
Defects are:
A cheap quality battery
Battery life is tooo low....
Sound quality is bad.....
They have mentioned dolby audio but it's tooooo low....
Camera quality poooor.. üò¨
Except this it's the.... Best....
Don't worry just buy it‚ù§üòç",4
"Just Upgrade RAM To 8gb and see the performance!!!
Budget Gaming!!!",5
"The laptop is very slow and gets stuck a lot but...you can get rid of that problem if you increase the Random Access Memory.
In the beginning my laptop was performing extremely slow.
Then I added 8GB of the memory (Crucial Brand) and after that the performance improved significantly. 4GB of the memory is inbuilt, so if you add 8GB of that, the memory will become 12GB, which is enough for even gaming.
Ryzen 3 processor is nice.
So without the increased memory, the Laptop is trash but after you...",3
Performance is very poor. The newest laptop hangs so badly,1
One of the worst laptops I have seen. It doesnt give the performance of Ryzen 3 processor. It is running far too slow than expected. Dont ever buy this laptop never look at 3.9 rating. Only way to make this laptop work good is to upgrade the RAM. Also the battery is too low. Power only lasts for 2.5 hours. This review is given after first time use. Also disk usage shows 10% in a brand new laptop.,2
Very slow..if you open anything it takes lots of time to open...but other than that it's good...sound is very less..picture quality is nice.. although it's not up to the mark..next time if I buy laptop I'll definitely go for intel processor...AMD is worst,2
Fabulous design with great keypad and touchpad,5
"Very slow processing,less battery backup
Don't go with this laptop if u want to do heavy tasking.
It takes time to even open Google Chrome.",2
Simply waste,1
"This is best under budget and value for money , for better speed increase the RAM since it's only 4 gb",5
Laptop is slow but if you are going for this consider upgrading RAM to 8 or 12 gb else go for 4gb 256 ssd or 8gb 1tb hdd. After upgrade it works like a charm.,3
"Best in the segment....strong build quality even it is plastic made.....4 gb ram a bit sluggish because amd processor is damn good for it to use resources but chrome is a Ram- hungry devil ...
Replace chrome with opera and install 8 gb of 2400 Mhz ram from crucial.....install additional ram will boost it ....go for it..if u want premium looks and best performance üòçüòç",5
"Ifter 5 days of use .... Taking time to boot up , performance is ok ok , rest all good ....",3
Only design is good in this laptop others things are worst the performance is very slow its taking too much time to open apps and it is hanging too much .and battery is also dropping very fast. I got very bad experience in this laptop.this is not value for money.,3
"Good Entry Level laptop for everyday use. Just one suggestion, go for 8 gb Ram...or upgrade it later.",4
"Everything is fine.
Note - need a ram (must) and ssd(optional) to work otherwise it's slow and also release heat.",4

"Value for Money,
Pros: No heating problem, Low cost, Light weight, looks attractive, pre installed Office home student edition, 1 year unlimited device antivirus protection.

Cons: Slow, cant run heavy processes, no gamming please.
Slow speed can be overcome to some extent by adding 8 GB Ram

re-rated to 1*
Reason - Head phone jack loose connection is not covered under warranty plus service centre lacks staff who can fix it.",1

I am writing this Review after using this product after 1 & half month. I purchased this product for my wife which she is currently using for her office work. Good thing about this laptop is it has good screen and performance is also good. Keyboard has number which is again a useful feature for working person.

It does its job and is a good budget laptop but do keep in mind that it is not meant for gaming and adding extra 8gb RAM (as i did) gives much more stable perfomance.... I got it for 25k for that price its absolutely great!,4

"Laptop is light weight and stylish in design. As per product description on detail page, it comes with lifetime MS office and free one year subscription of McAfee, but in reality the MS office applications are not getting updated and applications are not working as well as the subscription is only a 20 days trial and you have to purchase separate paid subscription of McAfee. Well the delivery system of the product is horrible and got my laptop after whopping 10 days.....",2

"Overall product is good. Good Picture quality, Good battery and good performance by processor.
But build up quality is not so strong, quality of keypad is not so good, it should be improved.

"One of the best laptops in the market at 26k ,I think I can't get better deal at this price.
But the performance of the laptop is average what we can expect in this prise range Other wise it is a complete killer",4
If you get a DDR4 2400mhz ram it will run fast as lightning and because of dual channel and 2 gb vram it runs games like GTA5 and almost all Big titles in gaming with descent fps on low settings .Check its benchmarks on youtube it runs almost all games descently.,5

Just bought this laptop.fully satisfied.worth every single penny.only one flaw is battery backup that is quite small.but charging is fast so no concerns. Do not purchase if you are a heavy gamer or want to do too many tasks.overall this laptop is good for students and professionals.go for it if your budget is around 25k to 27k,4
"At this price point this one is very good
The problem i faced is about speakers,the sound quality is very poor.better to but a sound bar or any small rated speakers",4

"This laptop is pretty good for the price tag it comes with. Got it for 23k in the big billion day sale.
the only drawback was the 4 gb ram...these days even phones dont work well with 4 gb ram. i would suggest anyone buying this should also get additional 8 gb ram along with it to make this laptop amazing.
The highlight is the design, thin bezels and display..i dont think any other company is giving these specifications in this price range.
i am Pretty happy with the purchase as i bought adat...",4

"The laptop looked great however the build quality could have been better (plastic body). Got MSO student version with it and one month trial Anti virus. Battery is good but that depends how Im using my laptop. AMD ryzen is a powerful range of processors, let's see how it holds up in future. Digital Dolby sounds great. Fast charging almost takes 90min to full charge from 5%. Decent webcam. Keyboard looks great but without backlit so in dark look hard. But the design looks sweet and slim.",4
After using it for a month now I can say it's too slow even in day to day tasks. I don't know with 4 gb of ram and 1 tb of hard disk how a laptop can work too slow. I also think AMD Ryzen 3 processor performance is not up to the mark it's too slow u must go with intel processors.,2

"Ordered it and received ontime. Firstly very bad camera, those who use for online meeting, full grains u can see. Battery drains fast 2hrs max u can use. First 10 days return period it was silent but after that fan started making noise too much don't know any solution to it. Overall average to little above average performance for this price range.",3
good laptop but battery drains faster not satisfied with battery backup it has overall performance is good except the battery backup.,4
"I loved it ?
WFH People's Just go for it.‚ù§",5
Good for online classes only ..if u try to open multiple tabs it just slows down..web cam and speaker quality really bad..,3
My laptop speaker sound is turn so low. Dnt buy it.,2
I feel little bit slow as hear about other person. Otherwise it is good for office work. Battery is also average not much atleast 2-3 hours giving backup. I will suggest all of u if u want to work day to day lifestyle just go for this laptop.. remember it carefully this laptop coming with plastic body..so plz use protection,4
Sound speaker very worst pls design speaker in top of the laptop dont put sound speaker on down audio level very very low,3
Good one,4
Nice product according to budget,5
Fan makes continuous noise which is irritating. Rest is just like any other laptop in this price range.,3
Super,4
I just think it's an average performing laptop. Maybe that's what you get for this price . ONE TIP use it on the LAP or a STAND if keep it on bed and use it for long it will over heat and start crashing until gets cool,3
Fab oneüî•üî• but battery backup not so good except everything is litüî•üî•,4
if you want for normal studying or office use then just go for it. It is pretty enough for daily task.,5

"Writing review after 2 week's usage, cheap plastic used for the surface, makes it look like cheap stock.

A simple task of click on the start menu takes 3secs to launch.",1

Very poor performance and dead slow,1
Good but not the best,3
Not a good battery attachment its daraining fast. On base of desing and display its a option for this budget. Overall performance can be more better i think for its not a good option for netflicks. I feel some lag when browsing and it is slow Some times,5

Hardly lasts for 2 hours.",3

Total Waste of money",1
Worst Laptop i have ever seen. very slow. i am So much disappointed with this laptop,1
It might have great specs but it is slower than 4GB Ram laptops my friends are having. If you are from computer science background tell me how much time should a system take to import a small library like pandas mayb seconds. But it will take 2-3 minutes. It is that slow. Trust me.,1
"This is not about the replacement product that I have now..
But about the piece that they delivered first...
Everything about it was horrible....
Performance:-
1. Graphics card: 2.5% (Avg benchmark: 10%)
2. Processor: 40% (59%)
3. Memory kit: 40.2% (41%)
4. Toshiba hard disc: 71.8 (67%)

Overall- 31st percentile (way below expectations)
Everything except the hard disc were horrible/below avg..

In effect, the booting time was very high (around 2-3 minutes, I'd say)
Time to open even a fol...",1
laptop performance is very slow,1
"Got damage battery.
Charges very slow about 10% in 1 hour.",1
Very worst product my laptop camera doesn't working and my laptop having 8gb ram but usable memory is only 5.9gb very worst and very slow laptop and hp coustomer care support also very worst service,1
"Product Performance is very bad, no one called its gaming laptop, its take 90 seconds (1.5 minutes ) for the boot windows, it's very basic operation, that performance at an initial level from the first day, so think if after user 1-2 month and install some software, what performance expect from this laptop?

don't go to buy this laptop,",1
Somuch Hang.very poor to operate.,1
Its nothing if you don't put a SSD and another 8 gb ram module ... it's so slow without a SSD that you can not even use it for day to day work ...,1
"Worst laptop ever
Stoped working just the day after it was bought",1
This is the worst laptop.....works very slow...i m not satisfied...it takes 5 min to boot...,1
Don't buy this product. Waste of money. Save your money. Iam disappointed but purchasing this.,1
it is the worst laptop i have ever seen .i am facing high lag .the processor is too bad.i am not able to play a game properly.valorant and gta 5 is not suited in this lap it is facing too much lag,1
"Don't wast your money this laptop too slow even if 8gb ram and 4gb navidia

Laptop is extremely slow... Don't buy it... Battery backup is the worstg part of this laptop...,1
PC is not working properly,1
"This review is after using for 1 week after installing all the updates and updating BIOS. This is a mediocre laptop. It just gets the work done. If you are purchasing this laptop, better get the SSD version or better get a SSD and upgrade RAM. The HDD version is really slow to boot up and takes 2-3 minutes after startup to function without stuttering. The initial 2-3 minutes after startup is really painful to use. My 2012 Dell laptop with HDD boots faster and can get to functioning properly ...",2
"Startup is very long

Battery is not good

Working speed also no good .

This is the worst experience in laptops I ever used .

I didn't use first 15 days due to some person reasons now till then my return period is over .

Please I strongly recommend don't buy this laptop",2
Performing worse than my expectaions. Even my Dell Latitude 3400 works faster and smoother than this.,2
"So this rating is for the laptop which comes in original condition without ssd. Before ssd laptop was performing below average and HP bloatware was dragging the performance down. So I installed a new wd ssd and migrate os in that ssd. Now the performance is improved alot. Machine boots in 7 to 10 seconds, copying speed is 22mbs/sec. And I am happy.

Laptop body is fingerprint magnet.

Recommendation- if anyone wants to buy this product install ssd in it. You will be happy.",2
Booting is very very slow,2
"Performance is average, and the gaming performance too is not so good. I tried to install gta 5 and ith lags like hell even at low settings. The battery backup is also so poor.",2
"The laptop review is written after a months usage
1. Windows home edition does not have ms office which is needed for any student: misleading information by Flipkart/ HP as they should specify.
2. Computer booting takes considerable time feel that I should have taken SSD rather than 1 TB HDD, seems a bit slow in response (maybe due to Ryzen 5 processors when compared to i5)
3. Very heavy weighing laptop
4. Scroll pad does not have separate buttons below so again left and right clicks are hav...",2
"Not good. After idle time close the laptop does not open and have to forcefully shutdown the laptop . Also, taking more time to start and open.",2
2 months it will work nice after that üôÇ,2
The laptop is very slow and it gives only 20-30 fps on gta v 720p resolution,2
Never buy this laptop with hdd it's slow like tortoise,2
Lap is too slow ... performance is too poor,2
This laptop is vary slow please go for ssd version,2
Too slow nd charge drain out very soon not worth it!!,2
I think it is refreshing,2
"Sent a defective laptop after placing an order it took just 4 days to deliver the product but when I applied for returns its been 8 days still the product is with me, the procedure to return anything is pathetic product is good only need to install an ssd for better percormance",2
I am Android developer running Android studio taking lot of ram also sound problem if I run my emulator making sound not run properly waste of money don't buy it,2
Not for gamers every game lagging display is very good but when I started playing games like gta valorant both are lagging after few minutes now tell me what's the advantage of buying gaming laptop if I facing these problems,2
"Some games are lagging , i dont know why this is
happening. I am not impressed regarding this product. Build quality is not good . heat control is no doubt good. Battery average. Charging cable is too small.. No colours variety is available, disgusting black
Colour.",2
"Everytime i am paying valorant after 3-4 minutes the screen is showing locking & shuts down...
After 1 months of use the screen is getting backlight bleeding & dead pixels",2
"Not performing as expected , 40 - 60% ram utilisation was going for OS ,
There is minor lag in games too like asphalt 8",2
"Takes too long to start...
High graphic games lag",2
cant play gta 5 smoothly with this 6gb ram a lot of lag occuring,2
"I wanted to write this review because there are couple of things not worth.

1 Design is awesome.
2 Sound is awesome.
3 Display is awesome.
4 Performance disappointed me, I bought the laptop two days back and it‚Äôs hanging many times. Even before checked game performance. single HD movie also hanged many time in two hours.

Before buying this laptop please check other laptops in this price range and compare with hardware.",2
"I purchased this Laptop looking at all the reviews, and also after going through expert comments and reviews on different websites. I really like the design, look and aesthetics of the Laptop.

However, when it comes to performance, I am terribly upset with the boot speed. I understand this doesn't have an SSD, but even with a Hard Disk, that too with the specs that his Laptop comes with, taking close to 2 minutes or more to get to the Windows 10 logon screen is too much. Moreover after loggi...",2

"Laptop functions quite slow, starting from power ON. Even same with browsing. I observe buffer. Takes lot time to open application and switch between them..
Not upto the mark. Facing issues while using office tools. Not worth the investment of 55K.",2
The product advertises that it can be upgraded upto 1TB SSD but it cannot and HP confirmed that. The laptop is also very slow. I was not at all happy with it. It‚Äôs supposed to be a gaming laptop but if it‚Äôs so slow how can one play!!! This false advertisement on the sellers part is unforgivable.,2
"After 6 month of User
It‚Äôs really slow
Takes lot of time to start",2
Be ready to spend atleast 5k extra on this laptop for ssd .Out of the box this is a very poorly performing laptop the reason is the HDD. Definitely need a SSD. After getting ssd now I could run the games with discord open before I could not . Now I could alt+ tab within sec before it would crash. If possible upgrade ram to 8Gb 3300Mhz then this lap is a beast at the prize,2
Laptop is a beast but very poor battery don't expect for a long time gaming should use while charging battery drains within 1hr for gaming and 2hrs of normal usage,2
Not suitable for gamers,2
If u want to play games buy ps4 or ps5 more better for games in pc or laptop some does not even work,2

Normal things take time like even if I want to open browser or my computer it srsly takes atleast 45-50secs which is slow for a 8gb ram laptop and imagine playing games or using heavy softwares.

"Battery is pathetic, like I was getting free electricity in Delhi due to limited consumption, but this laptop sure gonna hike my electricity usage.

Laptop lags a bit , atleast 128 GB SSD should be given , and yes ram needs to get upgraded too , in order to have good performance.

Rest okayish product. For average usage.",3
"System starts very slow sometime 12 - 13 minutes. Not happy with that, and if you want to use any good software or number of process then 8GB ( in that only 5.8GB usable its a Big Note to anyone who's is buying laptop because rest of it will be used for video card as per the laptop stands) is not enough.

But don't worry you can buy DDR4 8 GB ram and install so the laptop will be real fast and that might cost another 4.5k.

Overall I don't feel it's good to buy for 51k. Rather I would go for ...",3
"So I waited a LONG time to write this review. I have been using this laptop for about 10 months now and I feel that it is pretty good. It smoothly runs almost every game, and it is great for coding. I use it for literally everything, and it is a great experience. However, using this thing in the first 2 months or so was like the biggest disappointment. It was slow as hell, games did not run properly, and the boot took forever (still takes a bit of time). I contacted HP Support multiple times ...",3
"My initial product had to be replaced because of various issues, I believe I have recieved a product that was returned by someone else.

It was damn slow and plastic felt very cheap, like for example, when you lift the laptop, you hear cracking noise throughout.

Battery performance is very awful...only 2 hours battery backup which is very irritating you have to charge it on every 2 hours which might be very disturbing for all of us and the performance is not so great ....apps like even simple apps take 5 min of time to open which is also very irritating and PC needs different types of updates time to time and it take 5 to 10 kin of time to open. Processor is good and graphic card and when you use PC for 4 to 5 hours it heats up like a very hot cooker...,3

-Battery backup is okay (even after using normal applications. Don't know if u play heavy games!!)

-webcam is great.

-this laptop is a bit slower & its booting time is more which makes it look like its lagging. It should be more faster as it has an AMD Ryzen 5 ...",3
At first week the laptop was quite fast it's booting time was also less than 1 min. But after 1 month due to some windows 10 update booting tome went upto 4-5 minutes. And the laptop battery was also not too long for general purpose we can use it for 3-4 hours or sometimes even less. But I am happy with hp customer service because when my battery adapter failed to work they replaced it with new one. I could suggest you that instead of buying HDD you may buy 4gb 1050 graphic card with SSD. Whi...,3
The laptop itself is nice it can play most games at high graphics at 60fps i play total war troy which is a demanding game and it runs smoothly. The main problem arises when you start playing games like forza horizon 4 the game will run at 60fps ultra but due to very slow hdd and very low ram it will stutter. The laptop has 8gb of ram out of which 2.1 gb is hardware reserved for vega 8 graphics which itself is good and can handle most things on its own. After that the os will take futher 1-2 ...,3

Best Value And Discount From Flipkart.... But This Hp pavilion Ryzen 5 Gaming Laptop Not Good For Gaming Performance.... Please add some money and get better Version Of Ryzen And Graphics Cards.... Like GEOFORCE RTX,3
Satisfactory.,3
"1) Real daily boot time is 4 minutes atleast. Don't expect to boot in 1 minute.
2) lags a little while using from first day. Opening of apps is not that fast.
3) hdd used in it is of toshiba company. Hdd is not good its speed is slow.
4) comes with mcafee antivirus of only 1 month.
5) ADDITIONAL RAM AND SSD IS MUST in this laptop !!!",3
Good product but delay in delivery,3

"Using this laptop for a week. Here are some things I noticed.
Positive points:

Display is value for the money.
Design is great, body looks awesome.
After effects and GTA V runs like charms.

I do graphic design and rendering using Blender and it works fine I have no complains so far


Negative points:
Cyberpunk lags so I had to uninstall.
Problem in loading large Blender files
Lag issues in using big graphic intensive software.
Startup takes time, maybe buy an SSD version.

Not sure...",3
It was good but sometimes apps like blender and fusion 360 are not responding I don't know exactly what the problem is but I downloaded the apps with lisence but why the are not responding nad battery backup is not up to the mark I think it should be get more backup and charging speed is okay..,3

Its bad some error issues plz say any suggestions about my problem,3
It's take to much time to start and shut down it's with out SSD so windows is so slow,3
Just for normal works.....old rated product,3
"I donnow it takes 2.1 minutes to start only some times, i feel somehere d system is slow, may be bcz of No SSD, but still this shouldn't be this much slow, even opening photos, opening windows takes around 10 seconds some times even 15 seconds, and multi task also i feel not too fast, lets see after two days hw it works
Even the Adobe softwares response is also satisfactory, not completely satisfied",3
Worst customer care experience. Even after 6 days of my complaint HP was even unable to find what causes the problem and I am still waiting for an explanation from them.,3
Low battery backup upto 3.5hrs for normal usage,3
Awesome product.,3
Not bad,3
After one year the system becomes very slow. Initial starting take 3 minutes. Opening and closing application too slow. Low performing laptop,3

It is good but my delivery boy was very rude,3

Just need to add sdd and ram then it wll be beast,3
IF YOU HAVE MORE MONEY THEN GO FOR SSD MODEL OF THIS LAPTOP. THE HDD IS VERY SLOW AND SOMETIMES IT'S PERFORMANCE CRASHES. YOU CAN SEE LAGS AND THE BOOT TIME IS SLOW. RAM IS NOT SUFFICIENT AS PER THE GAMING LAPTOP. 2GB RAM IS RESERVED ALREADY FOR AMD RADEON GRAPHICS. WHEN YOU SEE THE TASK MANAGER THEN YOU WILL DISCOVER THAT ONLY AROUND 3GB OF RAM IS USABLE. IF YOU WANT TO PLAY AAA GAMES LIKE GTA5 AND FARCRY THEN DON'T EXPECT IT TO RUN WITHOUT ANY LAGS AND SHUTTERING. OVERALL THE LOOK AND DISP...,3

But I face a problem which is Slow boot. I write this review after 4 month Continue use.
Go for it But Mind it Insert a Ssd for batter experience",3
Am graphic designer. After using 1 month of photoshop. Lot of hang issues. So any one buy for designing purpose. Go for Ssd version. Not this. But apart from designing. It's really good.. üòá‚úåÔ∏è. Im telling only for designing people's. Not everyone.,3

Boot time is slow,3
No ssd so poor performance boot time 30 sec,3
"It is a very good laptop.
I am writing this review after one week of delivery.
I used this laptop and found some cons.
The battery life is very low and the 8 GB ram, we provided by 5.8 GB on which we used and the other 2.2 GB is locked for hardware.
Due to lack of ssd this laptop is slow working and boot time about 25-35 sec.

But overall this laptop is great.",3
Good,3
Man this is one of the best but of your gaming in this laptop. 8 gb ram is not enough you have to upgrade to 16 gb ram or directly buy same laptop with 16 gb ram and the most value for money in this laptop is graphics card,3
"bootup time is around 2 min, horribly slow system",3
If you are really into gaming and want to buy a high performance laptop do not buy it. Never ever go for Ryzen. I won't suggest you ever. I am writing this honest review after using it for a month. Do not buy it.,3
Little slow it's giving me reminder of first generation pc black and white once,3
Performance is slow,3
Best on this price range,3

"If you like to buy this product go right ahead, this is a great budget gaming laptop the two downside of this laptop is out of the 8gb ram you are getting only 6gb usable the rest is used by the system so i will recommend you to upgrade the ram with atleast 4gb or 8gb ram stick and the second downside is that the 5400rpm hdd is very slow so i will also recommend a 512gb ssd upgrade for gaming",3
The screen was not working . Chk before you take this product. Hope i get a replacement of a gud quality.,3

But it's booting time and performance is slow",3

Worst Laptop,3
"The Laptop is good but since there is no SSD, the bootup time takes much more than the expected time (Approx 4-5 Mins). The company is also not providing the MS Office lifetime access (which we have to pay separately). Sometimes even the responding time is also slow. Sometimes the type c port is not working properly for transferring files and for charging. There is no global warranty for this product.",3
Laptop is nice but the delivery of ekart is not good they damaged my laptop by applying hook on box which is very bad thing,3

Laptop is good..But the display quality can be improved.Having minor screen bleeding issue while using in the dark with black screen,3
Very slow. Takes a lot of time to start.,3
Product is good but while using it I can sense burning smell near the speaker and the battery I cross checked at hp service center and they said it is ok even though after a heavy usage often am getting a burning smell,3
3 star is because of delay in delivery. In a day of using the laptop it seems a nice one,3
Fornsome reason the lap was lagging from day one... Had to put in an ssd to solve it and i experience zevere frame drop while playing rdr2 in lowest settings... Domt know y... If anyone knows lemme know,3
"After 5 days of usage.
This one is pretty decent product, not installed any games. If anyone played games please let me know how is it's performance. However start-up seems slow is it only me or everyone's having same issue?

Not satisfied with the performance speed...,3

And you should upgrade to ssd then it gives good performance",3
Product ok but we need to upgrade to ssd,3
Dont expect too much,3
While running editing softwares for coding or some other big softwares...it slows down coz of the 6gb ram(+2gb internal graphics)...ram upgrade and ssd upgrade can help sort this issue....otherwise 5 out 5 on value for money.,3
If thay have added even a 128Gb SSD means it's an amazing deal..,3

Upgrade to ssd. Boot up is pretty slow as well as opening softwares. But a RAM too if you want a lili but of additional performance,3

Moreover, only 5.88 GB ram can be used out of the 8GB as 2GB ram is reserved for igpu this makes the games to lag a bit and they cant be run in max settings. I am personally a bit disappointed but I can't blame HP as they have tried to give a gaming lap in the extreme budget range.

1. RAM Mgmt is an issue as you get 6 GB for graphics and 6 GB for normal executions. (2 GB DDRAM is locked for graphics + 4 GB Nvidia). This will affect in prolonged usage. So upgradation of RAM is a necessity. (I tried a lot in settings to change and reduce the blocked but there is nothing you can do)

So I would encourage you to read through the full review before making a...",3
Battery is not good,3
"Expected better performance, but great dissapointment. It was lagging like anything. For basic use its okayish.. When it comes to Designing softwares or games there problem starts.
Looks so stylish and battery back was okay. Display not bad and at this price range MS office was not provided is something bad move from HP. If you are looking for gaming laptop pls go for something better. Flipkart delivery was not bad.",3

Noticed heating problems",3
"All works well only problem is it takes more time while booting.
And feel slow when opening an app I think it's because of HDD",3
Battery drains too fast but overall product is good . It is best for students and heavy gamers .,3
not up to the mark,3
Pity lagging,3
Looks are good but performance are not good as per Nvdia graphics and 8gb ram,3

Will not prefer to buy it, instead go for other seller or model",3
Fresh out of the box. Very laggy with COD warzone even at lowest settings. Watchdogs a 2014 game is also proving to be very laggy. I highly doubt if this Laptop can even play GTA5. Regret buying this Laptop for Gaming. Softwares like photoshop etc will work at good speed but disappointed with gaming.,3

There is a slight problem with speed. It doesnt have the speed of an 8gb ram device.,3
Amazing product... But delayed delivery,3
This variant is bit slow. The boot time is more than two minutes which is really a drawback of this model. Go for SSD variant to have faster performance. The design is awesome. The weight balance is so great tat you can open it with one hand without holding the base.,3
"The laptop is ok...
But don't purchase any big amount products from Flipkart..
Recently I got worst experience for...",3
Better to go for SSD,3
Everything about the laptop is perfectly fine except the charger. I cant understand whether it is damaged or not as it is overheating within minutes of charging right from day 1. More to add....BATTERY IS TERRIBLE!!!!,3
"Facing issue while charging laptop, , it took 2 hr for getting 10 % of battery charge and they say it's a fast charger.
Don't know if it's a software issue or a manufacturing defect but I need a solution for it ASAP. And laptop get's heated.",3
"better display , better design but without ssd it somewhere lag in the performance so its better if you purchase the model with ssd btw the product is good in it's range.
I ordered this product 10 days ago and figured out a problem with the trackpad and opted for the return. They have taken time but cooperated and now they are replacing my product.",3
It was okay for the pice but hp should give upgradable ram upto32gb,3
You are getting a powerful GPU at this price range which is great. The looks are great too. Heating issue is there a little but not to worry about it too much. The main problem is with the reserved hardware memory (Only 5.9 gb Ram is usable out of 8gb) which makes multitasking and even gaming slow( Games may also crash for not getting sufficient Ram). You have to upgrade the Ram at any cost. (I haven't upgraded it I will write a review after I upgrading). You may also install an ssd if you ca...,3
"I'm not sure, the features are great but the laptop is pretty slow. It takes a lot of time to boot. I have checked the reviews before purchasing but the laptop I received is not matching up.",3
Simply super,3
Good I like it best for gaming,3
When the laptop starts it is slow to respond.,3
Booting time is more compare to other,3
Laptop is built well. The trackpad is very bad. You need a mouse to properly use the cursor on this. Sound feels low. (Just like any windows laptop i guess).,3
"For that price... it's exceptionally good. Played Far Cry 4 at Ultra Graphics 1080p.. was super smooth. So was GTA V, Just Cause 4. So you can do pretty decent gaming. General PC performance is good. Photoshop 2020 (June) works perfectly and also other Adobe products. Display is super cool too. So yeah, a good system overall for that price.",4
"RAM upgrade is must do because the useable RAM is only 6GB, Ryzen 5 3550H is a great processor however eats up 2GB RAM in system, Due to that Heavy games like GTA 5 stutter, The FPS while gaming is good however stuttering happens when games doesn‚Äôt get enough RAM, Due to which I have to spend another 3.5K to put a 2nd 8GB ram stick.

If you guys don't know, the amd integrated graphics will reserve 2gb of your ram so you are left with 6gb instead of 8. HP has also locked their bios so we can't change vram settings either. It is what it is, I'll recommend that you should go for an Intel cpu if you can bcz amd might be cheaper but they will eat your hardware even though you are not using it at all so it's a waste of 1/4 of ram you paid for. Other than that Gtx1650 is a beast and ryzen 5 will ...",4

6. Games work nicely
Cons
1. A little bit slow but that can be upgraded using a ram and ssd

Overall i would really say this is a great laptop",4

Performance :- A little bit laggy... But if you upgrade with ssd then it gives you a good performance ..

"The true potential of this thing is unleashed when it's plugged in. Don't even bother to game on this thing on battery only. Battery backup about 5 Hrs on normal uses like browsing, video streaming etc with both wifi and Bluetooth ON.

2GB out of the 8GB RAM is reserved for Vega 8 which is a real bummer. So another RAM of 8GB 2400 MHz is recommended at slot 2.

Pair it with an SSD ( ofcourse nvme recommend ) and feel the difference.

Be sure to download GeForce Experience.

Battery mostly 4 to 5 hours
But performance was very nice
4 star for late delivery otherwise product was very nice at this price
Booting take normal time but its good in hdd

Over all its a good one ...",4
"The laptop in short is a beast.For peaple owning a laptop for the first time,it would be bliss.It has many flaws(with HDD).But for those who are willing to take care of their laptop,it will work like a charm.
Overall,I would say just to go for it.",4

I m fully satisfied with the product. Display quality is superb
But the delivery experience was not so good took almost 15 days to deliver the product..",4

Best at this price range only compromising thing is its ram but 6 gb ram also handle many AAA titles with ease but you may notice some of very high end titles sttuter like GTA 5 because of ram if you upgrade your ram to 12 gb or 16 gb then you will get the real performance of this lappy ....no frame drops after upgrading and handle 70% new games with 60fps ij high setting .....,4

In my case, the laptop speed is a little slow. If you add SSD then it will become more fast. so then thank you for reading my review.",4

-Display is awesome.
-Those backlits are awesome man. We feel like watching the backlits turn-on the whole day.
-Battery is below average to be frank. I get hardly 2:30 hrs backup.
-Speakers are good, but not the best in this price rang e and especially when they mention B & Bo audio system, I expected more from it.

"4 star is only for in this price they can add a 120gb ssd. Because of hdd machine is lagging to much, response time is high. Others all good.",4
The only problem is ram. I was only provided with 6gb of ram and there is no option in bios to free the ram. Else every thing is good.,4
Nice,4

"Add ssd worth 3-5 k and it's beast at this price range
Btw adding ssd do not violate the hp warranty",4
"Gaming performance is great but other than gaming, it's slow because it doesn't come equipped with SSD. If you can extend your budget go for SSD variant directly or you can just buy this one and install it later.",4
"Performance isn't consistent . I think this may be due to processor or the updates for windows 10. Definitely needs SSD minimum 256gb coz the laptop feels incomplete without it . For consistency on performance and reduce the application load time or boot time.
The way things are right now it's walking needs SSD to run.",4
"Nice performance, almost good",4
U should definitely purchase this laptop as its a budget one... It does hav many features but i got the issue of booting time and slow opening of apps..... After that update it to your latest version and the laptop will work smoothly,4
"Everything is good but probably the worst HDD installed. You cannot game even when you get a perfect FPS because it takes time to load and retrieve the data from your hard disk. But for this price, if in case you have installed an SSD which costs around 5k for 500GB M.2 nVme then you can game or do something productive with no issues.

So an extra 5k is required unless you do not want to hard gaming on this.

The plus in this laptop is even when you game a lot with sufficient space and venti...",4
It's a budget laptop. It has fullfilled all my requirements from playing fifa 20 to coding and installation of appium.,4
After purchasing the laptop it's speed was slow. Due to high graphics you will get 6 gb ram. And don't even think of playing high quality games without upgrading your laptop. But after 15 days of purchase... I bought a 8 gb ram and 256 gb ssd... After upgrading my laptop became very fast.... So u must spend additional 8k rupees for upgradation !!!,4
Laptop is very good.. looking good.. design good...but it lags sometime...and it is slower than expected üò£üòî..So if You want a beast performance then upgrade it's ram and SSD... Battery is average...and this is my dream laptop..and now I have this dream ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è,4

I'll update the review afterwards",4
Best laptop for students,4
Best laptop in th 50000,4
When system is starting than it will much slow open and its performance is also slow otherwise it was best its better also good,4
Need to upgrade SSD for smooth but performance with hdd is good for low end users,4
Great product . But if possible get yourself a SSD and 8gigs of extra RAM then you will enjoy it at its full capacity. HDD is too slow. And other than that it felt value for money.,4
All features are very good ..but battery backup only problem ..less time working,4
It would be a 5star product if it has more battery life . It ran out of battery in high performance however can cope up with it in battery saver mode,4
Good,4
Battry life is not up to the expectations...it drains completely in 2 ton3 hrs.,4

Better to use ssd for fast speed,4
Overall happy,4
"After 1 week of usage.
Should have gone for SSD is the only drawback. There's another slot for expansion, which is a good option.
No lag issues and maximum boot time is between 2 - 3 seconds which is good for HDD these days.
Ryzen 5 is just out of the box. Battery life is also good. We can manually enable 4K with AMD settings on the system.",4
U have to add SSD for better performance. When i switched it on performance was not good as i expected. Bought 250 GB Kingston additional SSD. Now it's good.,4
It's nice product,4

Using it with HDD is like buying a 400cc bike with normal tyre, need to boost it up with SSD
Perfomance truelly enhanced by 10X after adding SSD

"The display panel is so light ,that it literally moving under the celing fan.its completely plastic",4

Got it for 48650/-",4

just U have to add an extra 8gb ram to run smoothly.. no other choice.. extra around 2500 rs for ram...
and u should know that 2gb ram already reserved for system usage..
it means even if u upgrade the ram upto 16 gb still u can use only 14gb... just mind it before buying it.. and it matters.. üòï

Just slap on an extra 8gigs ram and most games would run 30-40fps at medium settings.

Battery is not as good as other laptop.
Performance is not very great.
Still.its fine.",4

"Due to the hdd... it's boot time and app opening time is slow but overall it's ok for a budget gamer.... The design is awesome as a gamming laptop but the top flex is visible. Built of the top is slightly disappointing.
But the overall the built quality is ok. The huge disappointing thing in this laptop is that the usable ram is only 5.4GB out of 8 gb I'm very disappointed for that.",4
"Battery drains very fast & this laptop is super slow.
The main problem is in this laptop it's take so much time to start (one &half minute maximum) & it's folder opening speed also very slow,",4

Good working,4

Very good,4

Battery is not God,4
If u r going for gaming then u should upgrade SSD and Ram then it becomes beast.,4
"Slow booting up with hdd,, but overall good in price segment...",4
Worth the money,4
The laptop takes very long to boot up...every app that I open takes very long to start..I don't know what the problem is...sometimes the laptop just freezes.....and while playing fifa 18 I noticed some frame drops which should not have been....because the GTX 1650 is a great processor....I tried to consult with the hp support ...but they said it's not the laptop defect....it's windows defect,4
Everything is good except an SSD would make a lot of difference in performance...and secondly the processor is little slower than intel i5 8th or 9th gen. But it is good compared to other gaming laptops in battery backup.,4
"This laptop is very good
But you have to upgrade the ram and ssd
After upgrading it will become beast",4
it takes too much time to boot .it takes around 1;30 minutes,4
Battery backup is very low and performance is ok ok.! You can invest 5-10k more and go gor some better option.!,4
"I bought the laptop for more than 3 months now if you are a gamer go for an upgrade of ssd which will make your overall performance good
The speakers are stunning compare to other laptops the b&o audio took it to the next level
Display is epic with the streaming 4k video which is cool
8gb ram only 6 gb usable because of the consumption of integrated graphics card
While gaming with hdd face lag issues for nfs payback bit after a bit its okay
After a month i face a little bit of crashing issue...",4
Good,4
"It's boot up slow, tools are 40 seconds due to HDD, otherwise it's OK.",4
Speed is slow but value of money for hp laptop and I suggest go with ssd varient,4
It's good device in this price range packed with a good graphic card sleek design and a pretty decent processor the only and biggest draw back lack of ssd though you can cop it with a additional sum of 5000 bucks by adding a ssd ( got with nvme m.2 ssd) and you will be left no complaint.,4
if add the additional SSD in this spec then will be seen a good performance,4
Laptop is very good but the hard disk variant is slow but once you installed a ssd in it you will the beast performance.,4
Excellent Product,4

Nice product but i feel like without ssd the performance is not satisfying.,4
"The laptop was superb. But its bppting is not too fast ot takes about 30-1 min. 3-4 days aftet buying there was a problem that i cant open setting, taskbar, windows etc.
So i rebooyed it. But now its working excellent",4
Everything is ok but it take time to open sometime good value of your money,4
"I have been using this for over 4 month now.
It has geniunly stood up for my needs
Been doing some coding and cad drawing using solidworks

Works just fine with this graphic card.. Rendering speed is good but
1) u will need a ssd asap
At this point takes around 3 minutes to start and lags for some seconds too.
2) this does not include office
3) has macafee antivirus for only 21 days

Other than that coders, designers, students. If you are on a budget go for this one. Best of luck",4
Ssd is the real need and 8gb ram if possible,4

I was told it would be delivered by 11 am but delivered at 4 pm",4
Aavarage system running slow,4
"Laptop is okay . But some times it become unresponsive when I use premier pro. 2gb Ram is acquired by the CPU for iGPU. But it's value for money if you can pls upgrade ram and make partitions in HDD.
It's perfect but some time it lag away.",4
The laptop was nice and all things are good and worth.but there is issues because of HDD lagging issues. But there is a slot for SSD also. While i set the SSD it was a good experience and no more lagging. So while you buy the laptop you should add ssd in it.,4
Prosser is poor but value for money üí∞,4
Really great product üî•,4
"Reviewing after 10 months
Yeah comparing wd the price the laptop is a beast. No battery problems yet,
No heating or lag issues...yeah but for increasing gaming experience you definitely need to change some power options which u can easily get on YouTube.
I've also made some changes in amd control panel which boots performance.
What I liked the most is it's cooling system.
Talking about issues...yeah sometime I get this weird lowy bell sound coming up in sleep mode or idle mode...i seriously ...",4

Not bad. sometimes laugh when you upgrade ssd and ram it will be good,4
Its work very slow.,4
Nice,4
"A very good laptop for the price. Totally worth it
I am totally satisfied with the laptop.
I have tried multiple games and had very little issue as I always run them on full graphic. Use medium settings for higher specifications games and keep graphic drivers updated all time for best performance. I only have one issue that is of battery life. It has very low battery life of around 3-4 hrs.
All in all best laptop for gaming and heavy software",4
"Such a nice laptop in this price range! But I'm feeling little bit slow, while booting up pc and while updating windows os!
But otherwise it's super cool and working like a monster. No lag in games! Mainly I purchased this laptop for my development works!",4
"Only good if you upgrade your ssd ,ram is not necessary very slow without ssd after upgrading ssd it's a beast",4
"Worth to buy .....
A very good laptop in a good price..
I will definitly pitch all of u to buy this...",4
"The product was well packaged. However to optimize this gaming Laptop to its full potential, to play games require more than 4Gb of RAM you need to add another 8Gb of ddr4 ram. For faster performance also add at least 240Gb SSD. Slots to add RAM and SSD is available.",4
"Its a bit slow due to hdd. Upgrade with a ssd for better performance. The battery is draining a bit fast than I expected. Otherwise, overall it's an awesome device",4

Display is good
Screen Flip mechanism is good after 8 months by by flapping thousands times hinges are good as new

Display is good i mean right now i am writing this revie...",4
"Good experience with hp
Without ssd performance is poor",4

Believe me it's not that slow ...You will feel its slow only if you have used a ssd variant before ..

"Decent product , good for gaming , don't even think for buying it for daily purposes",4
Very good laptop for desent gaming,4
Nice good laptop,4
This product is great in the price range of 49K. I would suggest to upgrade ssd and ram after purchase as it will turn this into a more powerfull machine. The only shortfall I found was the fact that bios locks the advanced settings area which limits ram of this lap to 6 or 5.8 gb and wastes the potential of 2 gb in igpu which is not needed as it has a dedicated gpu as well,4
Can anyone explain what is this small white light for?,4
"3 day used.
I purchased this product only for normal purpose and
Adobe Photoshop.
This is good for me",4
Overall pretty good gaming experience but poor battery,4
It is good... Boot tym is slow... But it could be solved by increasing the ram....,4
Very very good.... I am completely satified,4
"Everything is perfect according to the price but it definitely needs a ssd upgrade
Rest all is excellent",4
Beast,4
Entry level laptop,4
Nice one. Increase ram for better productivity. That's it. People say go for SSD. But it isn't compulsory. HDD works fine as well.,4

About slightly slower",4
"It's a great laptop but it is heavy also,...so plzz keep this in mind ..
But not much heavy ..easy",4
Indeed it's a great laptop looking at the specs but I have never seen a laptop which is this slow just because of a HDD. Other HDD laptop works really fast than this thing. If you're purchasing this laptop either purchase the SSD varient or buy SSD separately and install. HDD of this laptop is too damn slow. Otherwise Graphics is great. Battery backup is decent. Display is crisp. Design is great.,4
Only disadvantage that I expect is fast battery draining (2-3 hr normal usage )... Except this a nice picküî•,4
"Display is decent with good viewing angles and no color shift and all
But the battery life is pathetic as it discharge 40-45% in 1 hrs as my use ( im not a gamer ) i was just running some very basic tasks like html file and thats it.. the speed you is also bad beacuse of hhd but if you add and extra m.2 nvme ssd it becomes baburao ;) but as it ships with hhd so you have to face slow boot time and app loading till you upgrade to ssd .. and yes it does heats near hhd area so energy loss it defi...",4
Very nice products in this range,4

It's a very good Laptop.i face only 1 problem with the laptop is performance cause in this laptop 1 TB hard disk that's why it's to slow as compared to SSD veriant.bettry life is to good.laptop look is pretty good.,4
Weight is too much,4
Best in the segment & price,4
HDD is slow... but not too slow.. better to add SDD. the build oor strength of laptop could have been better. overall a good performer. Battery is decent,4
Good budget laptop but not a beast ....... Looks great and all is good,4
High performance,4
"I brought it at 50k,which is good for this product.it is useful for normal usage and for students.",4
Product Is good but you should go with Asus because there is only 4 gb ram usable out of 8 gb this is the worst thing of this laptop and delivery is to late so I have cut half half star for both the reason.,4

Battery - 4-5 hours
Design very good design with backlight keyboard",4

Good display
Games in high settings runs super cool but ram upgrade is felt. While switching from game to windows.
Backlight light is good
Speaker are good quite loud
Cons
battery backup is not good while doing work.
Gets hanged frequently bcoz of ram as most of it consumed by processor


Rest I am good with it, pl...",4

All good but processing low because HDD. So i recommend buy with SSD,4
Everything is good but it takes long time to boot.,4
Battery is a average factor 3/5... But overall price and features 4/5.,4
At this price its worth buying without a second thought.,4
Good,4
"Good product for basic level gaming, designing, autocad, photo shop and it comes with good price",4
"Best laptop for this price range, Best display. Performance is great, it has extra slot for ram and ssd. The only drawback is that hp locked the bios due to this the vega graphics reserves 2 gb ram so only 6 gb ram is usable because of this games like GTA V, Shadow of the tomb raider, RDR 2 stutters (playable but annoying). Upgrading the Ram to 16 gb fix this issues and makes this a bang for the buck.",4
Nice,4
If you are a gaming person than ram upgradation is must. Build quality is upto the mark in this price range .,4
"Great gaming laptop in this price range. You can easily play most modern games on High settings and get around 45-60 fps.

One thing that they don't tell you us that 2gb RAM is reserved for the integrated graphics so you only have around 5.9 gb RAM available which can cause issues with latest games. So I would suggest getting an extra 8gb RAM if you want to smoothly play all the latest titles.",4
"It is a great budget buy as it has capacity to upgrade
Like extra ram slot (which you require soon as ryzen blocks 2 gb by default) and m0.2 slot for SSD so ample opportunity to upgrade value for money",4

"If you upgrade it with an extra 8gb ram supported with SSD, then there shouldn't be any complaint about its performance. Yes, sometimes the mouse cursor gets stuck somewhere, but that is only for a second and not frequently. It handles most of the new generation or AAA games pretty much efficiently. Overall, I'm really satisfied. But you need to upgrade it with SSD and another 8gb of ram.",4

In this price range it is beast. Boot up speed upto 6 seconds . Display is awesome there is no screen bleeding problem. Resulation is also good. Build quality also good. Sound is enough for a single room not so bad it's good.

The only drawback is battery life but that is common when you buy gaming laptop with screen resolution as 60Hz and above. Go for it if you could buy it at 45K.",5

Screen bleeding issue,3
"I'm reviewing my laptop after 2 weeks of purchase.

Performance:
This laptop runs on 8GB RAM Ryzen 5 Quad core 3550H processor which is powerful enough to run AAA title games at high graphics easily. It has 4GB dedicated graphics card which makes it easier for the high end games to run smoothly.
Always run the games with charger plugged in. If you run games on battery, you might see lag and drop in FPS.

Design:
Bezels are really thin which makes its really stylish. It has plastic finish, ...",5
"This is my first laptop one of the awesome laptop I've searched in internet, i have no issues with this laptop, the best for gaming (mine is ryzen variant) i do some programming and photoshop too in this laptop, very smooth and zero lag in gaming and editing .

it has a light heating issue, build quality on top of laptop is not a scratch resistant use it softly and some battery issue if you want to do gaming and high processing work, do while charging is ON it gives its max...",5

Bought this during the Bigbillion sale for 45k. At that price it's a beast. It has no shortcomings compared to other laptops at that price. I'm completely satisfied with the purchase. If you want a laptop for only gaming then I will recommend you to invest a lil bit more and buy something with a higher refresh rate. But you cannot go wrong with this laptop. It has the ddr6 version of 1650 and also has wifi6 (you need a compatible router to experience that). Decent keyboard with backlight. Ve...,5

I feel so bad it dosen't have CD slot but rest it's working good you can buy if you're okay without cd slot and it dosen't come with any kind of subscription it sucks so be careful,3
So it came 3 days early and didn't had any manufacturing defects i was worried about the screen bleeding but there wasn't any if anyone thinks the screen is a bit yelloq of this laptop then it's because it's FHD IPS display that brings the real colours instead of vivid the graphic card is pretty good for this price but the CPU isn't that good they should've made it a hexa core instead of quad core if you're planning to play games on this and stream as well then you might wanna go for a hexa c...,4

Heating is too high when gpu is turned on .

I had run benchmark tests after bought this laptop. Then the result is Rygen 3550h is not better than even i3 10th gen U processors. And no big difference bw rygen 3500u and 3550h. My suggestion is go to intel processors,3

"I am a new beginner into photography. after doing analysis of which camera will suits to learning.
For that I purchased Nikon D5600 because I feel it has good features for entry level dslr as quality of image really good.

I haven't used it much but now I am investing my time to do proper camera settings before any photography session.

Worth buying all I can say.",4
packing was good. product was upto the mark the camera has a well to do autofocus and the lens are superb,4

"Item received in cared pack and good condition.
The camera supplied is brand new and in perfect condition.
Only thing the battery was in a open pack, don't know whether it is Company's standard practice or otherwise.",4
"no CD no Cable has been given, but the product is good.",4
battery is too dry fast ... only 250 to 300 photos taken for full charge..,4
really fantastic camera .....I love it,4
"Its a beast At 40,000 no camera can meet the expectations of a photograph better than Nikon D 5600 just go for it ,worth every penny ,video quality is out of this world ,With snap Bridge and wireless function you just need to click and share on WhatsApp Facebook Instagram etc.",4
Good 9recording more than 4k video,4
I didnt get the lowpro bag or samsung headphone which come with nikon d 5600 and you r also not taking the complain i got a low quality nikon bag,4
"Awesome camera, few images with 70-300 lens",4

"Perfect Camera For Photography at this Price Range.
Just Go For it.",4
Good product.,4
Super,4
Really good product i like it,4
No need to describe...just see my photos .. Suggestions is buy 18-200 MM lens to click in seconds pics than not required to change lens.,4
Its been two days since I started using the camera. First thing to say is that I didn't get bag along with the product. They could have provided a bag as its a costly dslr. Some people said they got a headphone along with the product. I don't have any complaint about not getting the headphone. But carry bag is an essential accessory. 4 star only for this reason. Otherwise no complaints. It's a good product as we know.,4

At first I was confused between canon 200d mark 2 and Nikon d5600 and after choosing nikon d5600 I have no regrets this camera is capable of taking great images and the kit lens are great for beginners because I am a beginner too I was a mobile photographer but then I felt the need of upgrade and bought this camera really it's like you have an AWM in your hands and it is on the user how he uses it,4

"D5600 is perhaps one of the best entry level DSLRs in the market and certainly in this range. I had used D5100 for several years now and wanted to upgrade for getting benifits from the new advancements like the touch screen, ability to sync and with smart phone and option to remotely control the camera, GPS sync option and higher resolution of the sensor.

Pros:
‚úìLighter than D5100
‚úìFaster auto focusing and focus tracking ability with AFP lenses that are supplied in the offer
‚úìAlmost silent ...",4

"Even though it has 2 antenna, it has very bad range.",1
Not working within 2 years,1
The range specified in description is not the same.I have 1 bkh n the range won't even reach from bed room to living room. Not able to connect with my broadband user name password gets disconnected after some time. The router get restart automatically,1
Bad experience from this router don't buy this router..,1
Could not exchange also. Still not use.,1
very bad product...had a horrible experience using it...,1
internet signal is break,1
"I used this product for a month, had to eventually return it to the seller,
The WiFi range was not good, along with that , it used to constantly drop out on signals,
I had speed of 16 Mbps but router was delivering not even close to 8 Mbps , had to reboot the router every half an hour in order to reconnect.(Signals kept dropping every 15-20 mins)
Do not plan for this router, you'll end up replacing or exchanging it.

Cheers!",1
"connectivity problem. Works well 1st day. thereafter no internet access. After giving 1 hour rest to the router it works fine for 5 minute but after 5 minute again no internet access. Again giving 1 hour rest to the router it works fine for 5 minute but after 5 minute again no internet access.
WORST PRODUCT
Also contacted support.in@tp-link.com for replacement/solution of the device problem. But no response from them.
Very bad experience from TP Link. Dont buy this defective product dear al...",1
The product is good and well packed. I can good result from one channel (2.Ghz). The other one is just for a show. The wifi from 5 Ghz reaches only a few feet. It was a great disappointment. I will not recommend any one to buy this product.,1
"Flipkart promised me the product in 2 days. I ordered the router on a monday, was to be delivered by Wednesday latest . It didnt arrive on thursday , so I gave FK a call and asked them to get to me by friday atleast since I had ordered it to my work address and I have saturdays off . The customer service guy told me that they couldn't deliver it on friday (which was 2 days later than what they had promised me) and ASKED ME TO COME TO WORK ON THE WEEKEND so that I could pick it up . I told him...",1
Worst Customer service and useless RETURN POLICY,1
The rating is for Flipkart for giving false description of the product. This router doesn't come with USB port. If you are looking for media share/printer stop looking at this product.,1
Of no use !! Usb port missing as mentioned in description,1
"Item is not as per description, it does not have USB Port, I have returned it long back but yet to get payment back. I have informed flipkart regarding description but yet it is not changed as on 12 Oct 2017. Please do not buy if you are expecting USB Port.",1
"Worst delivery service by flipkart. There are not able to deliver the product on time. ..and don't bother to update you on the issue. I must say that now on I lost my trust on flipkart.

Product is good but worst service from flipkart.",1
Mrp is 1984 and actually available for 1893 rupees in Amazon,1

u guys should really get out of the house and go buy it from SP road.

Dont be lazy like this seller :)",1
"The product shipped without charger. Earlier I didn't check the missing part, when I saw product found quality issue thought to return that back. Now came to know that seller is out-rightly rejected the return request. I re-checked the item and found missing part issue too.
You can get the cheaper same model in ebay and many other sites. The seller of this product is not the right person to buy.",1
Wifi disconnects some time,2
Connectivity issue with 2.4 hz,2
upset with the product it's junk.. signal üì∂ disconnects frequently within the room.... Don't buy this junk. Giving my rating after 10 days of use.,2
LAN cable not given,2
Range of signal is poor for both bands,2
This model has some issue as I need to reset it everyday of it goes offline and there is no wifi connection. Otherwise range and coverage is good for a 2bhk flat if u keep it in the centre room of the house.,2
"Wastage of money if you want to buy this router..

PROS - Looks good.

CONS - Range is very low.. 5ghz band range is more than 2.4ghz band.. The signal strength drops suddenly and is upto 10m only..
The device also heats up during prolonged usage..
The leds are not very much visible..
The led shows internet connection available (i.e green) even though there is no internet..
The body attracts dirt and finger prints..

Over...",2
Speed was not upto mark....,2
Charger that in this box is not working properly and range extender mode not working properly so i returned,2

Router stopped working after 6 month not happy with product,2
Not meet expectations,2
"I have bought this by recommendation of some youtubers which was my big mistake.
This router delivers good speed but it has very poor range.
Only one network is showing in ground floor from 1st floor and my house is small.
This is not price worthy. If your priority is only speed then go for it but if your priority is range then buy an extra range extender.
Otherwise i will recommend mi router with 4 band(price worthy) or other router with 4 band.",2
Looks not working as excepted.,2
Daily twice in a day hanging issue,2
"Strength of the 5 Ghz band decreases rapidly...only getting it in 1 floor....even the 2.4 Ghz band strength keeps fluctuating
Also the color of device doesn't match with what is shown in the picture",2
Rang issue,2
5ghz was not at all getting net.. Always switching to 2.4ghz .then what is the need of taking dual band,2
Range is not good,2
Frequent disconnection..,2
Not god not bad,2
Internet is not getting with speed sometimes it doesn't passing net,2
Range is too low.. the signal dips to 1 bar if you just go one floor up or down. Looses connection often in these condition.,2
Rang problem,2
Network coverage is not good.,2
Poor 5ghz range,2
Not better.....as expected,2
"Avreage router. Internet connection disconnecting automatically from service provider modem. Some times, internet connection was slow. Need to fix bugs in new firmware update. Tplink tether app also good.",2
Ok average,2
Not providing continuous network. After every 15 minutes i have to turn off the router and then only i can use it. Not happy with TP-Link Archer C20.,2
Range is not up to the mark,2
Router is good but it is very light weight and the plastic quality is very cheap which make it fragile. I have been using tplink router since 2015. My old tplink router was 300mbps and the build quality is far better than this one and lastly tplink also cut out the length of the given Ethernet cable which make it so small to connect my destop pc via ethernet. Although performance wise its okey.,2
Very slow connectivity & also connection break eventhough internet is active it shows no internet i thought it will work the best but i am not satisfied with the poor performance of this router.,2
Not a worthy product for its price!!!,2
Didn't Cover larger area of my house,2
Not good range,2
"Router is not working properly,it is hanging, every time I need to switch it off and on ,after switching on it is working fine, again next same issue",2
"It's automatically disconnected many times, have need to restart,",2
Range of the dongle is not upto the mark,2
Wifi connectivity is very slow,2
work not properly,2
Range is very bad,2
2.4 Ghz used only 5ghz not working properly not much range this router,2
Very low range.... instead single band router is better...waste of money. For this one.,2
Range is really bad,2
Bad Singal Bad,2
not properly work and damage box,2
I brought this product after going through reviews. This product's performance does not meet it's price tag. After 3 days of continuous use my wireless internet speed and range have reduced drastically also I'm experiencing frequent wireless disconnect in both the bands.. If you are looking for consistency and performance this is not the product.,2
"Giving very weak signal, my last router Tenda with antenna was working better that it ..",2
It's always keep disconnecting,2
Bad products,2
Don't speed,2
Range was very less,2
Range is too poor.,2
"Looks good. But the range is low. The moment you close door ,becomes difficult to get signal. Not suitable to a 3bhk.",2
Didn't Support Excitel ISP,2
"This one star is for the seller, in the the description you can see the device has QOS feature (quality of service). But while checking their is no option available in the router console.",2
Not have proper coverage,2
Ok but range is not good . Not good as compared to price.,2
"After using for 4 months, it only giving less than 100 mbps speed. I have asked the internet provider, they said this device will be less than 100 mbps. if u want 150mbps, go for 4 antenna router.",2
Range is not upto the mark for 3BHK,2
It is not a modem,2
Disconnect every 5 minutes,2
Nice,2
not so gd d link is far better dan dis,2
After one month it's has disconnecting problem flipkart is doing scam,2
"MAC FILTER Wont work for those devices which are connected with LAN port. If u add Repeater with it, any one may be able to connect to your network by password. Mac wont work.",2
Product is good. I have internet speed plan of 100 MBPS and with 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi the seed is just 75 to 80 MBPS. And with 5GHz the speed goes upto 92Mbps. I don't think this can support 150Mbps as per the chart. Design and look is good.,2
Range is less for 5G band 2.4g runs ok but even not that great range. Better to choose other with 4 or 5 antennas. You can get in additional rs 300/-,2
Issue with internet connection frequently disconnected,2
Covers Range not as expected !!!,2
Router Range is very bad connection,2
Yeh product TP link WiFi router connect nhi horaha,2
"I have a basic 2.4 ghz router. I am a technical person. I bought this dual band router considering 3 Anntena's & it supports dual band (2.4 Ghz & 5 Ghz). This router is not good as it's range is even lesser than the basic router I've of 2.4 ghz, yes I am saying it on 2.4 Ghz frequency. Forget about 5 Ghz. 5 Ghz is is just for 10 or at max 15 feet distance. I am fine if 5 Ghz works in lesser range. At least 3 Anttena's should give better coverage on 2.4 Ghz band.... even that is not at all com...",2
I don't get good signal even in next room.,2
equal range,2
WiFi range is very short.,2
seems to be wifi connection dropping in between and bad range.,2
adaptor came faulty.. bad product,2
duel band not working,2
not good,2
range is not good,2
"compared to iball baton of 2 antennas , this one is weaker...not satisfied",2
"i am not satisfied with the product
my net speed isp provide 25 mbps

1.but 2.4gh speed test 15 mbpa to 18 mbpa only not full speed
2.range is not good 20 meter range 2 signal and 30 meter no signal",2
Range ia poor,2
decreased speed due to heating up.,2
"Horrible range! Comes with 3 handsome antennas dont know why. Doesnt even provide full strength across a 10m radius.
No heating issues. Nice service, but range is too small if compared to other 3 antenna models.",2
It's good,2
"Does not connect automatically after the reboot !!! Everytime I have to go to the tplink page under wan setting to connect again ,did everything, upgrading the router nothing changed !!",2
I purchased this from flipkart but the performance is not as good as expected there was many bugs during connection and. The range was very average i was unable to get full coverage. this is good for small house and offices. instead of this i purchased TP Link Archer C20i which much better than this.,2
order is delayed but quality and stability is good and perfect in working .. amazing product from flipkart ...quick installation ... make the delivery fast,3
First day of using the router ..can't put up a detailed review ..but the signals have been good till now .. dropped a point or two at a distance of 15 feet with just one wall but then even cellular network is also hard to get in these newly constructed buildings. Wifi signal stregth is good at 49 dbm and hd videos are running just fine with my 6mbps connection,3
It offers a decent range but is not justified for the price(Rs2500) but it is a good router if you are able to get it under Rs.1500. When I am standing near (complete 4 bars of signal) it provides the full speed .I returned it because the main problem in the router is the signal fluctuation. When I am standing 5-6 m away the signal keeps on altering between 2 -3 bars.Dont buy this if stability is your priority. Again sometimes it gets disconnected automatically which is really annoying.Three ...,3
"I have been using this router over 2 weeks and its a decent router at this price. Found below issues:

1. Often when I start the router, both the 2.4Ghz and 5 Ghz networks get disabled automatically. I have to go to settings and manually enable them again.

Update:
after using it for nearly 15 days... these are my conclusions
1. signal quality is decent . you'll get good speeds if you are close enough
2. well , i live in 1 BHK flat ... range is good for the first two room , but the 3rd one suffers severely ... it's just one bar out of five and sometimes even zero

This router looses connection often. I have to reconnect the internet manually and sometimes reboot the router when it goes mad. the range is good but a little disappointed with its inconsistency.,3
5g spectrum not good.,3
"While unboxing the product, I was really impressed with the solid build quality, features - dual band, USB sharing, the looks, quality of accessories
The speed obtained was full 75 Mbps when router was placed next to my Macbook (My ISP connection is 75Mbps). For 1 wall obstruction I was still getting 50-65 Mbps.

But it seemed the firmware was buggy. The issues were:

(1) Sometimes (I'd say 30% of the time), my Macbook Pro won't connect to the TP-Link WiFi - neither 2.4GHz nor 5GHz. Or someti...",3
"This Router is pretty average to be honest. I have a 150Mpbs and getting max speeds of 80-90Mbps in 5Ghz and 50-60Mbps in 2.4Ghz. I do not know about the range yet as I have routers for every room so never get to test the range. Instead go for Archer A7 with slightly higher budget if you going to use only one router for whole house

Edit: Because this router has a 10/100 Mbps Wan port, it won't receive speeds more than 100Mbps, still the company dares advertising it as 750Mbps router. Because...",3
I ordered this router as my old Tenda router barely give connectivity on groundfloor as I have kept the my router on 1stfloor so I ordered this thinking it will give a better range. Unfortunately it has worst range than my old router but it does has a range extender and access point feature so I placed the router near the stairs of fround floor and firat floor to work as a range extnder and reaolved my issue.. if you already have a router than tbis product is worth buying or else go for some ...,3

"Flipkart has done a great Job here. My issues are with the product. I got two of these and major Fault here is, 5 GHz band has real issues while connecting. By defauld 2.4 GHz will be selected but mobile phone has a setting to with stronger band, I have to switch off and on again to set things up on this Router.",3
"Coverage is good for this price range
1. Even after two also I get 5 to 10 mbps(100 mbps connection)
2. First floor get signal (router is in ground floor)- speed around 30 mbps right above the router and far away I get around 5 to 10 mbps.
3.Main issue is router needs restart(some times twice a restart) If internet connection drops(fibre ) and then come to get connected to the internet. Its very irritating.",3
Good,3

Better is to buy tp- link archer c6",3

Frequency Range is not good as expected.Speed catch up to 100mbps only.,3
This is good,3
Router is good bt range is not too much satisfactory and if you use less than 100 mbps then i will not recommend this one. Cause 4g and 5g will give you same speed.,3

Product is very good but the packaging from Flipkart was really bad it was not even packed they only taped the invoice on the original box and thats it.,3

Ok Ok,3
"The product is good i used it as a range extender and in lan mode
Eventhough they say the provide 750 mbps i was able to retrieve only 100mbps where my connection is 200mbps otherwise its good and range lessens faster than a gnx router like ones",3
The maximum speed is 100mbps idk why it's advertised as 300+,3
Good product!!!,3
Product it's good but packaging of flipkart it's to poor,3

Functionality is good but needs restart every second day or third since it get freezed,3
Speed is very good but rang is very low,3
"Checked speed through 5g and 2g, almost same not too much difference, I have chosen this much costly only due to 5g. Those who are thinking to purchase it for internet on mobile and pc I suggest to buy in the range of 1000 rs. Router, this much investment is not worthy",3
Good,3
"Some time it's automatically closed
Then we need to reset from the plug so if u are doing any payment or particular work this will stop and your work is stuck so this is the wrong thing in this router",3

It stopped working within 20 days of setup. Tried alot but no use. I suggest not to buy.,3

An ok product. There are better routers available at this price range.,3
Power router is very slow. 5g speed has have nice speed.remaining 300 is very low,3
Ok..,3
Nice,3
If you don't need dual band then go for mi router. Wi-Fi coverage is not as expected. Mi router has better coverage than this.,3
Wifi sinal not strong enough.. wifi dropping frequently for equipments connected even 5-6 meter away from the router.,3

Range is not very good...overall ok.,3
Nice products,3
Range is not upto the mark,3
Ok,3
"Router is very good in working....
The range of this router is little less than single band router....
Prefer this router if you have very heavy usage and multiple devices to connect... (you can connect many devices simultaneously since it has dual frequency bands)...
Install this router in your passage of home for better connectivity.... It is enough for a 2BHK....",3
"Range is ok
Working good",3
5Ghz network range is very limited.,3
GOOD,3
this maybe a tp links product but range is very short or should i say atena is very weak... i pace the router at my homes wall with open window and the signal is 0 after 50 meter out side of my house,3

The range is very limited..,3
Good riuter,3

Good but range isn't better,3
good easy setup but range not good,3
Good item,3
Very nice no problem uptill now and good signal too,3
Not so good as expected,3
1) Range coverage area is less,3
Not so good. After heating it continuously give high ping of internet,3

value for money,3
"My previous tp-link router which was 5yrs old was better than this. I just order this bcz of dual band feature but v.disappointing.

Low range.
Wifi is disconnecting everytime.",3

I thought it would be worth but it's just like normal router to be honest,3
Good product,3

speed is good but somtime connection is lost,3
"Dont expect anything great or surprising out of it
Ordinary router",3
"i given 3 due to range , range is shorter than other all router but the function of router is awesome",3
the range is even shorter than two antena router in 2.4 GHz also... Not fully satisfied with the purchase..,3
Range of signal isn't that long. Quality and strength of signal is good.,3
I bought this to replace my now faulty 841 N also from TP link. My expectation was that this will increase the range of the wifi signal given that it has 3 antennas. This is however not the case. Being a dual band router is the only advantage that I found in this router and this helps me keep my Firestick traffic different from the normal mobile traffic.,3
Good ...,3
product is good but range is too low,3
good,3
rang is not good,3
"average, if you want more speed go for the ok other top variants.",3
"Not so fast as expected
Only with two mobile",3
I expected more range from it. The signal hardly reaches first floor opposite corner room. The router is in ground floor.,3
Good but not very good.,3
Spped has increased but lags sometimes,3
good,3
great 5,5
it has good connectivity . but it's coverage area is very less when compare to d link router.,3

"there is no usb port in this flipkart is giving wrong information about this router.
listen flipkart, please don't give wrong information about product.",3
not so good,3
Very low range,3
I didn't get all the features as exactly mentioned in product specifications. for example it does not contain any USB slot as mentioned under specifications. Also the look and pattern is different than what shown on Flipkart site.,3
Good product....,3
"Okay product, i am not technical person, but after changing from my old router to this three antenna TP Link this is okay, lot of time to get connect you get two wifi name for same router whats that thing i dont know, overall okay product.",3
Working well.. Using it for two days... Fast configuration.... 3 star for so much late delivery,3
Product seems to be good but delivery got delayed.,3
"Amazing. Would have been better if the transmission could go further.
Update: Sometimes 5G has issues. Not a game-changer.
Update after 2 years: MASSIVE 5g issues. Do not buy.",3

I don't get cd inside box. So I can't connect desktop with this router..where I get this resource Cd tell me?. .,3
Good product,3
i am getting the signal from 2 floors up.........really worth buying.......and one thing guys the lan cable is too short...about 2 feet ......,3
I am having a 3(G+2) floor bungalow. The product is having two frequency 2.4 Ghz and 5. Our nic currently using 2.4 ghz. The range was not as good. My router is configured on 2nd floor and when I am working on 1st floor. I am seeing the 2-3 network pipe out of 5. When I try to access the same from the ground floor I do not get any access for both of them. Cannot be recommended by me. Can review this prod with two stars. But I purchase this prod from flipkart. So I have given 3 stars.,3
as i expected receiving wifi signal is not so good. mac filtering etc... such options were not applicable when to connected via WDS,3
Technical problem hai,3

For mobile usage, 2.4G is best. Overall it is a good buy. But don't get fooled by reading 5 star reviews which say it will give you optimum speed to your devices. i.e. In 40 MBPS plan, download speed will be 5 MBPS. It doesn't work in my case. It is totally depends on your internet service provider. Also depends from where you'...",4
"Value for money. Okay at this price range. Good to emit dual band frequency. But compared to the archer c6 which I also have, this one is less powerful and range is also not very good",4
Stylish and Sleek also Very Lightweight easy to Setup but some times wifi gets disconnect automatically when you use different band with different passwords other than that its very good buy in this price range,4
Great Router at this price. Earlier i was struggling getting good internet speed even though i have 100 mpbs plan. Switching to this router really worked excellent. Now i am getting not only good speed but also great coverage in all my rooms.,4
Flipkart thanks to timely delivered but ur delivery boy does not wear mask and not sanitize a product so i gave 1star less wonderful product and nice work,4
"Good enough for my use. Video conferencing, YouTube or similar services stream smoothly. Security features are just fine for small office or home. Remember this is not a modem. You will need a seperate modem. This has the RJ45 input which is what one may need with a cable internet service. This is a dual band router. So in close proximity (within a room or rooms with thinner walls), it will auto connect at 5Ghz else at 2.5Ghz at a longer distance. Of course you have to know or figure out how ...",4
The router is a good one. Supports both 2.4 ghz and 5 ghz. But sometimes I feel like the area coverage for the signal is not much. Anyhow is a good one. You can consider buying it. Flipkart delivery was fast and the packaging was very good.,4
"I previously used this product for free thru ACT Broadband in Chennai, now moved to Bangalore, so decided to go ahead with the same for the below reasons :

> No Disconnectivity
> No Speed Fluctuations, My Broadband Plan is 100 Mbps i.e. 12 MBps, however i received Max speed of 9.7 MBps so far, could be ISP Limit
> 5 GHz will be accessed from the same room, 2.4GHz can be accessed from neighbouring rooms
> Setup is Easy",4
"In this router you ll get to know the importance of 5ghz(dual band) router. Regardless of your ISP's internet speed(*min of around 30mbps), you ll get good speed in 5ghz band but the range will be less.
Where 2.4 ghz has good range but less speed.

Example:
Provided : ISP speed 50mbps.
In 5ghz you'll get 45+mbps (but short range)
In 2.4ghz you ll get 25-35 mbps ( larger area is covered).

I've heard that 5ghz is supposed to be faster then 2.4ghz..but didn't noticed any difference.. And range of 5ghz is super shitty.. 2.4ghz is preety good.. And for the price.. Its a preety good deal,4
This is a very good ptoduct for the price but it sometimes does not connect to the 5 GHZ band. The range is good & can cover a medium sized house well,4

I have been using this device now for 3 days and it's been good. Nice light weight model and easy to configure.

The signal range is available till some 12-14 meters from the device (I hav even been able to watch Prime/Netflix with just one signal strength) so it's pretty strong enough.

I have also been using it for like 16hours a day continuous. End of the day it didn't have any heating issues. Plus point.

My internet service provider gives 150 mbps speed and by enabling the 5GHz freq...",4
Getting dual band router in around ‚Çπ1300 is a great deal. Happy to own it. but dont think that as it giving 3 antenna u will get some awesome Wi-Fi range. no. it just cover the same area as a dual antenna router do. because it transmit 300 Mbps data over 2.4 GHz band which is same as a dual antenna router. & on 5ghz band it transmit 433 Mbps . but the range is very low. but overall performance is decent. look is nice. generating very low heat. a good buy i must say..,4
"Out of all the devices out there in the market, TP-Link does prove its point as a trust worthy name and not heavy price attached.
The range is also pretty satisfactory as my 2bhk home is well covered, almost 95% of the area is :P
Safety also hits the mark as does any device these days. However nothing remains safe in this world, but offers all the mandated ticks.
In short a great offering at the price.",4
"First things first....

Even in the pandemic flipkart gave me one day delivery although it was scheduled for a day later. So big thumbs up for that.

Now to the router, setting up is a breeze have been using only for a day so need more time to give in depth review.

- Range is good for the 2.4 ghz band and even behind walls and closed spaces shows fair signal and speed is also good.
- 5ghz on my TV took some time to get going but now streaming 4K content on youtube smoo...",4

"nice router,nice using experience.......
these is my 1st route ever. Best router for regular & 1st time user. Because these router provide more & more new feature. It is best budget king router in these segment.",4
This router is good and it's signal range is also pretty impressive. The one problem with it is that we cannot connect to the router. This happens rarely and there are no other issues with it. Best budget 5ghz frequency band router. The 5ghz range is not so good because there is only one signal antina but you can expect a good range form the 2.4ghz band. Go for this router if you want a dual band router at low price. Everything works perfect and no connection drops till now.,4
"pretty good and decent product, works well for 10-15 devices and has sufficient range for office or home.",4
"its a good router with 5ghz band wifi
this allows higher bandwith therefore making the end user experience very good
setup was easy and hasssle free

minor problem after 2 mnths was the ac adapter stopped working unexpectedly
had to change it but TP-LINK service was good tooo came in a day or two

overall good router.",4

"Impressive delivery. Even during lock down period they have delivery within one day.
Product quality is also good.",4
Good product no issue,4
It is good for security reason but the range is similar to a two antenna router. Because the middle one is a 5 Ghz so either u can connect it or turn it off. I turn it off because range is insufficient. I put the router on first floor but it cannot even reach ground floor(both 2.4 & 5 ghz) .,4
IT'S A GOOD PRODUCT. ALSO IT HAS IT DUAL BAND....,4
range is lower than I expected,4
Very nice product..,4

Awesome Firmware.

Best Router for advance user.

If u r looking for Long Range Router this router is not for u.",4

It's absolutely worth the money for a 3000 sq feet area with 1300 sq feet of constructed area.

One single con is that it does not reconnect if network goes down. One has to manually log in and reconnect. Or restart the router.",4
Very good,4
amzing range of network and quality is awesome,4

This one is a good router and it looks good also. But I would say that if u can afford then go for a gigabit router.,4

Good Product.. purchased n installed last week only.. Good Connectivity Coverage.. 3 yr warranty mention..hope it will last long... I thought connectivity will be poor in bedroom from hall where I installed this router but surprise to see good network connectivity across 2 BHK. Price could have been bit lesser but overall good.

But there is a major heating issue.
Otherwise product is greatly working.
I have 65Mbps fiber optic connection from Bittel,and I am getting almost 60+ speed everytime in 5Ghz band.

Faster than expected delivery. Though the delivery guy did came late on the day of delivery. Installation was easy as well. The Tether App also provides good control of the network and monitoring. Overall good purchase. I will update the usage review a little while later after 4-5 days of use. Initial usage looks fine.,4
"5ghz range is not very strong. Signal goes down very easily between rooms.
If you don't have specific devices which can utilize the speed of 5ghz then simply go for single band router with 2.5ghz frequency.

Having dual band doesn't makes sense when you can't use it.",4
It's awesome op speed and the quality is awesome,4
Nice product,4

"I'm quite happy with these product.
Good range.

Mobile app is quite good..(like to have the feature of bandwidth restrictions in the mobile app although it's there in the intuitive web platform of the wifi). The app is user friendly.
For darker shade it gets a little bit hot..but usable.",4
Great router 2.4 GHz works fine 5ghz has very less range great for 3bhk,4
Great product by tp link. Good performance. Not a single issue faced in last 10 days. Dual band worth it. It simply feels the difference between single and dual band router. It seems itz 2 routers with same name only with the diff of 5g at the end. I think there is only one thing to add is the charging light on power adapter. There is no such light on power adapter.,4
"nice router giving good speed
I guess the area coverage should be more.",4
Felt little problem during installation through tether. After installation it's good. Enough for a 3bhk flat or more,4

"I like this router and with good build quality.

Things I don't like:
Range: if you are sitting in a room and your router is on another side of the room then the signal will go down almost half.

You'll get a cable connector with this router, I think its price is around 10-20 rupees according to the quality. I suggest you to buy good quality cable.",4
Good and working fast. Coverage range could have been more. Connects flawlessly with any number of devices,4
"Good but I had a thought that 5G Band in this will have a higher range, however got to know technically higher the band lower the range and hence no complains against the product, working fine and as expected with its normal band getting good range and it's all good.",4
Router is good. But speed is not accurate. Don't know if it's problem with my ISP or the router.,4

Pros:-
1. Build quality of this router is great.
2. Antenna range is awesome for 2.4 GHz for long range, 5 Ghz band is also give good coverage for low range.
3. Application interface is good. You can download the application on android or iPhone devices. Application name ""Tether"".

Note: If you need better coverage then connect your device with 2.4 GHz band or connect your Laptop and Desktop directly to the Ethernet cable.

"Guys currently Amazon is shipping ver 2 hardware which is not compatible with cable broadband like Alliance Broadband, Hathway, etc. You will get good download speed. But there will be no upload speed. Ver 1 is for India and other Asian countries. Ver 2 is for Europe and lastly Ver 3 is for sale in US.",1

Post powering on, router was not allowing to log in and the message use to appear ""only anirudh791*@*****.com has offline access to this device"" .

Please check the vendor before buying any product.

Amazon should thrash such cheaters.

Amazon agreed to replace the same. Hope no more surprises!",1
My first TP link router. Good build quality. Bad signal range. Faced multiple disconnections from day one. 5Ghz band barely held signal within a 5 meter range. Most times I couldn't even find the 5ghz connection to connect to. The 2.4 GHz band wasn't effective even in the next room. I wanted a Gigabit router to maximize my 100 mbps connection speed but this barely touched 20 Mbps in the next room on the 2.4 GHz band. This has a worse range than the entry level Netgear routers. This probably works better in a setting with no interference of walls/doors. I had to return it and bought a Tenda AC10 instead.,1
"I ordered this router the first thing after amazon started delivering post lockdown. The product performed well. Delivered the mentioned speed and has a decent (if not better) coverage area. Enough to suffice a sub 1800 sq. feet apartment (Walls and objects impact greatly). If however, your house is bigger, I recommend a higher power router.

In my case, the router just stopped working one fine evening and the Customer Support is so damn pathetic, every time I call them, it takes me 20 min to connect to a Customer Care Rep when I register for warranty related issues. When I do, I have to explain them the whole thing with details every single time (no, they do not keep a record), after which they say they'll send you a mail but somehow always forget to. It's been more than 10 days and 4 calls. No responce. Egregious service!

In conclusion, please buy a product from a company who gives a damn about their customers.
(Pst pst, D-link)",1
"Does NOT do its job. 2.4 Ghz connection completely unstable.
I am getting range of about 2 signals in a bedroome that is around 30 feet away from the router but no internet. Otherwise the 5ghz one is giving fine speeds. But I did not expect the 2.4 ghz connection to have drops and I am experiencing some drops in the network from time to time. The MIMO is not clearly visible.

Very bad router. No range in the next room. Completely useless. Not once am I able to stream video content hotstar/netflix etc. I am using an old single band router.

Edit1 :
This is bullshit from amazon. adding the reviews of many tp link routers together. Confusing the consumers into buying bad products.",1
"First one arrived, set it up and within a week it conked off.
Wi-Fi stopped connecting
Ethernet link shows down
Connecting to administer via Ethernet cable was a test of patience
factory reset did not help

Returned and exchanged in hope of getting lucky

second one arrived....
This time it went bust in a matter of hours..

My advice: Avoid it like a plague",1
"The 2.4 Ghz channel keeps getting disconnected every 4 hours and after that no devices are able to connect on the 2.4 Ghz channel. The 5 Ghz channel keeps working as expected. This is not a one-off case, this issue is reported by lot of people in last 1 year and no firmware upgrade has been able to solve it.
TP link website given no indication of a solution or a firmware to solve it. Very careless behaviour. Don't buy.",1
"This product is beast when it comes to specifications but it offers very poor wifi performance. Speeds drops consistently , Poor wifi signal ( Not even reaching to 1st floor ). Firmware issue and Tp link usually provides updates rarely. Even after modification of settings by Tp link customer support via remote link there was no improvement. Even Ethernet speed issue with this product. High Price very less performance. Think twice before buying it. Many be if Tp link releases hardware version 2.0 it may be good. Amazon as usual fast delivery and returning item because of poor performance ( may also be defective product ).",1
"I bought this router back in March of 2020 and I have been using it since and at the time this router looked good on paper and I have been using a Older TP-Link router for past 3 yrs so I went ahead and bought it. This router is the (US) version which amazon is selling in India. At first, the router was working well. I didn't experience any speed related issue on WIFI or on LAN.

There was some connectivity issues on CSGO (using LAN) but I thought it was a problem from ISPs end. But later, I found out the router was causing instability. After few months or constant observation, I came to the conclusion that my router was causing the issue this whole time and after a few searches online it was obvious that I was not the only one having the issue. I did contact TP-Link support and they fail to solve the problem. I did update the firmware to version 1.1.17 (20201010) but the issue is still present.

My ISP provides - 100MBPS (Download)/ 50MBPS (Upload)

Router gives 17mbps download and fails the test later. Mostly It can't even complete the speed test.

Rebooting the router fixes the issue for 5-10mins maybe sometime for more time but the issues persists to this day. I have also heard that they fixed that issue in (EU) version. But amazon is shipping (US) version in India so no luck there either. There is no DD-WRT support yet for this version (TP-LINK Archer C6 AC1200) so the last thing you can do is send this to the warehouse in MUMBAI and wait until TP-LINK send a replacement and Pray that works fine.

PS: Don't fall for the specs the issues are real and makes the router completely useless.",1
"TP link ho gaya hai pagal..
Completely different product from C6 and it's written on box also it's C6. Tho in actuals this product resembles A6...
I had ordered C6. But what I got is a product which is A6 in look wise. Totally confused with this mystery. Returning it .

Tho I tried to install it., But speeds aren't upto mark. Supports one mesh that's written on box., may be coz of which speed at 2.4Ghz is v poor.

Don't Buy. Not recommended. They will send a completely different product which isn't a oh la la product üòÇ

Update : 1.03.21
returned and received the same model again ..
To solve the mystery i opened Tplink webpage .
what i have been send is C6 Ver 3.20 . design is exactly same to A6. This doesn't support Mu- Mimo although its written on box that it supports. Instead it supports One mesh which i guess isn't helpful to many people unless you have a existing mesh device already installed.
what they have displayed here in C6 Ver 2.0 but they are no longer selling it ( only old stock)

i will not recommend this C6 Ver 3.20. speed are vary .. in 2.4Ghz it drops to 15 mbps even if you are just 1 feet away from router. in 5Ghz it works good .. my plan to 150 Mbps and it reaches easily to 140 Mbps .
decide accordingly .

Thank You.",1
"Don't go for this product, its the worst router that i bought recently. My ISP said 'buy dis dual band router v suggest evry1 and alas without ne research i bought it and made myself frustrated. The signal disappears automatically for few secs and then also reconnect automatically. This happens frequently and jst mk u irritating n frustrating. Calld 2 tplink CC, replace d sockets, assignd a dedicated channel, changed MTU size in d router webpage bt none worked. Finally going 2 trash it. Its a genuine review n nt d paid 1's.",1
"Router is a very average router. It does provides blazing speed when you are around it. But the whole point of wifi is you should be able to get good speed at reasonable distance. By distance i mean in adjacent room the wifi connectivity is spotty for both 5ghz and 2.4ghz. FireTV stick at 10 feet distance is barely able to stream NETFLIX in HD quality continuously.

I recommend to either go for C1750 or higher router or jump to Netgear router.

PS: I have an 100Mbps Connection. I get 97Mbps on 5 ghz and 25Mbps on 2.4 ghz bands when I am near the router.",3
"This router is great for 5GHZ Devices or anything that goes below 60MBPS because the max output from 2.4GHZ Wireless band is only 61MBPS MAX however if you switch to 5GHZ than it's fast,
I have a 100MBPS connection and most of my devices are 2.4GHZ supportable and it's not an Ideal router
even tho it claims to have a 300MBPS connectivity in 2.4GHZ Wireless bands
(Tried on multiple 2.4GHZ Devices, with optimal Channel, WPA2-AES and 40MHZ bands but it's still the same)
WORST FOR 2.4GHZ",1
"I brought this product as I need a router that could support high speed internet connectivity. The router stopped working after a month. When I contacted Amazon they said that they (Amazon) cannot do anything as the return window had closed. I was asked to contact TP-Link. The customer care put me on hold. After waiting for almost 45 minutes I called again the same thing was repeated. I also send an email to TP-Link. But I just got an automated answer saying that my complain has been registered and they (TP_link) will look into the matter soon. I waited for their response but nothing happened for a couple of days. Then I posted my grievance on their Facebook as well as Twiter accounts. This worked and I got a reply after five days of continuously chasing TP-Link on various mediums.
Now I have been asked to courier the router to their warehouse. Thay will look into the matter only after they receive it at their ware house.
Lesson learnt - buy a product only if a local dealer is available.",1
"It seems to have a faulty 2.4 ghz chip mostly and not the firmware side. Because people have been facing this problem with all their typse of router as per a post on their forum. I am experience frequent disconnect on the device which tries to connect on 2.4 ghz and it works when device reboot. I have few IoT devices which does not support 5 ghz. Sad that the day i am writing the review a day before return period is over exchange is not possible now. To soon to get such hardware failure.

Update:
I just removed the stock firmware and installed OpenWrt and open source networking framework for routers. And problem is solved. So, i was correct it was only the firmware issue not the hardware. which a brand like tp-link not able to solve, sad. I would still suggest stay away from it. I wonder if i every will be able to buy tp-link router again.",1
"I've been using TP-Link Routers at home and work for quite some time now, however since I upgraded my net speed to 100mbps I had to get one these so-called Giga Routers. Like in the past I assumed this would also be a Set-up and forget about it like all the others before it.
Once the set up was done I could log-on to the net for exactly 2 mins before the Router would REBOOT! Thought it might have been a 1-time anomaly or might have been something wrong with the connection.
Got the connection check, replaced it one of my old TP-Link Routers and it was working fine.
I wasn't getting the Full Range and Bandwith I was getting with the Giga router but at least it was rebooting involuntarily every few minutes.
After checking everything else I concluded that there was an issue with the router I received.
I checked Online and turns out some of the other users of this same C1200 model were facing the same issues as well. None of them could find a solution.

I have returned this Router ... It might have been one of those 1 in 100 defective piece or there might some an issue with this model an not sure which. However, I would recommend anyone buying this model to check for this issue on the day they receive the package.

Please Note I have reordered another model of TP-Link Router and am hoping that doesn't have the same issue.",1
"My experience with this router is very poor. Firstly the signal strength of the router is not as great as it is made out to be in most of the reviews. I bought this router to replace my perfectly working Netgear WNDR 3700 series router which did not have MIMO and beam forming but otherwise had b/g/n and only had an internal antenna with USB support.

The signal from this router does not go much further than my older router despite having 4 antenna and beam forming.

Many of my IoT devices and a couple of Raspberry Pi which worked flawlessly with my Netgear 3700 router simply cannot connect to this router for no apparent reason and they work in the 2.4Ghz band so it should have been perfectly compatible.

My Dell Laptop which used to connect flawlessly with the WNDR every time now mostly does not connect automatically and I have to manually connect it.

This router has a buggy firmware for sure even though it has the latest firmware and is c6 v 3.2

When connecting to any internal device using SSH, the keystrokes take time to appear! I had never experienced this with the Netgear.

Note that this router is NOT compatible with dd-wrt open source firmware, so you are stuck with the TPLink software and there is absolutely nothing you can do about it.

Overall I think this router is really poor if you are a professional who has many devices and many protocols. It may work fine for average users, which explains the misleading number of positive reviews.

I've finally decided to disconnect it and use my original Net Gear WNDR 3700 again. This device is hopeless.

Update on 24/6/2021
Despite calling their ""Customer Support"" 8 times in the last 4 days, there is no response. The customer service phone number is a call center where they understand NOTHING. You basically tell them and repeat about 5 times. Then they promise an engineer will call you within 24 hours and now after 72 hours and 8 calls there is still no call. Their explanation is that they call from Avaya and not by normal phone so something is wrong.

ABSOLUTE FRUSTRATION.",1
"Purchased this for bsnl ftth, which came with syrotech wifi router.
Using archer c6 V3. 2 in router mode made no difference to the wifi signal strength which i was receiving with syrotech, very disappointing. Moreover since this the new version V3. 2 it has firmware issues wifi signal drops and comes back intermittently which is very annoying hope this issue is resolved soon by tp link. If you are considering to buy this router on reviews please reconsider this product is wrongly overrated.
Currently i am regretting my decision to go with tp link
Edit- After july2021 firmware update C6 is performing good giving stable wifi .But If ur considering buying router in this price range go for Linksys E5600 which regularly goes on sale for 2700 rs
It also has EASY MESH support which can create a mesh network with another linksys E5600 or other Easy mesh compatible router from another company. Tp link does not offer this great feature ,it is just trying to sell mesh extenders .
These days of fiber connections speed ranging from 100 -300 mbs ,mesh network of routers is a absolute necessity to get full speed in every corner of house.",3
"TP-Link Archer C6 is a good looking router, but not serving its main purpose. The wall penetration is adequate but not as good as üëâ""Tenda A10"". Mine is a 100Mbps connection and following are the speed results;
---------------------------------------------------------------
5Ghz - Same room, 104Mbps up & dwn. After a wall, (4-5m) no range!
(to get the max 5Ghz speeds, disable the 'auto band switching' to manual in the router settings)
2.5Ghz- Same room, 30-45Mbps up & dwn. After a wall or two, 15-25Mbps up &dwn.
---------------------------------------------------------------
The rage of 2.4Ghz is good after 3 walls but the speeds are terrible. After many reviews and articles, I found that among Tenda A10, Archer C6 and Archer C60, the TP-Link Archer C60 is the best performer. But the problem with TP-Link Archer C60 that, it has no gigabit port.

üëâ If the connection speed is 100Mbps or more, gigabit ports are needed. Even in a 100Mbps connection, the speeds are limited to around 90Mbps without the gigabit port. üëà

I got two of these C6 modem and both are terrible with video calls. Constant disconnection!! Returned both of them and got Tenda AC10. Now everything works perfectly. Tenda AC10 also have the 2.4Ghz slow speed issue. Now I am planning to return it too and go for TP-Link Archer C80 AC1900. üòÜüòÜ",1
"Appario might send you a used item. Be warned!

Model: Archer C6 V2 (EU)

This router supports only the band 1 on 5GHz frequency.

Everytime the router reboots it will reset the bandwith of 5GHz frequency to 80MHz. So everytime the router boots up you have to switch to 40MHz manually. I was told by the TP-Link India customer support to set the bandwidth to auto instead of 80MHz. On Auto mode the bandwith on router was always set to 80MHz which I don't want.

Firmware is simply laggy, takes 3 seconds to load a menu on the Router management Page.

Router emits 2 hidden WiFi that you have no control over ( this hidden wifi is used for OneMesh). Even if you disable the Wireless radio for both 2.4GHz and 5GHz radio the hidden network will still be enabled. A TP-Link representative said that this is by design. However, I'm pretty sure that TP-Link added an option to disable it on it's other higher-end Router.

All the problems that I have mentioned here were posted on TP-Link's community forum so check it out to see if these problems were fixed.

Many have complained of unstable 2.4Hz WiFi radio being unstable and that their device were disconnected from the WiFi. I didn't face this issue because I don't use 2.4GHz.",3
"Does its job OK. Good hardware for the price.

But currently there are massive firmware problems for this device that lead to WiFi problems, especially on the 2.4 GHz network that make it unusable in many cases. Check the TP-Link forums before buying. So unless you want to get your hands dirty and test every bit of functionality and become TP-Link's QA department, go for something that's plug and play. Technical support will not help you with anything beyond a standard set of solutions. Their phone support has abysmal wait times.

5 GHz radio only supports bands 36,40,44 and 48. So if you have multiple TP-Link Archer C6s with some configured as APs in your network, 5 GHz can operate only at a 20 MHz channel width. This is not mentioned anywhere on their product page. Also, the WebUI says 5 GHz is broadcasting at 20 MHz, but its actually putting out an 80 MHz signal, which in my case means unusability due to interference between 3 APs. Email support hasn't got back to me in a week, and they are ignoring my emails.

Also, no ethernet backhaul for these devices. OneMesh is wireless backhaul and works only with a TP-Link router as master and a TP-Link range extender as slave. So if you plan on using multiple router units to enhance coverage at your home/office (some in AP mode), WiFi roaming is managed on the client device. There will be no intelligent hand-off between different APs.

TL;DR : Too many firmware issues. Non-existent technical support, even if you provide them with detailed testing data. Specifications not as advertised. AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE!",1
"You won't get any satisfaction in purchase of this device. 5 GHz band access point of this router proves to be completely useless 90 % of times because most of the times it starts an unending cycle of connection disconnection which is so irritating that you would feel like smash the device. There is no repeater mode in this device. Also, IP reservation settings are confusing and sometimes ineffective.
Once there is no internet, this router does not allow you to access any IP address on WAN side.",1
"After a year wifi signal started fluctuating then I contacted to support center they were told me that submit the router to our service center, they don't have a home pick up service as D-Link have, they told me your router will be replaced it will take 30days for it. After 30 days they handover me a refurbished product instead of a new replacement. That is pathetic.",1
"Archer C6 takes 2-3 minutes to boot up in comparison to 20-30 seconds of my 7 year old 150Mbps single antenna Dlink DIR-600L router. Idk why this Qualcomm chipset is that slower than that old router.
I've a fiber 60 Mbps plan. I place router next to window not a bricked wall so that signal spreads better.
On 5Ghz Archer C6 gives great 58/59 Mbps speed but for 12 feet circle. While on 2.4Ghz I was getting poor 30Mbps download and pathetic 12Mbps uploading sitting next to router and 6-8 Mbps on the next to next room of same floor (24 feet). I tested a lot of times. In comparison my old Dlink router gives both 30-45 Mbps upload and download speed for 10-12 feet circle and 6-8 on 24 feet distance.
I've tried to reset Archer C6 thrice and changed different settings but poor 2.4Ghz performance remain the same. Also the range is pretty average on 2.4Ghz. I couldn't even connect on the floor above with both 5Ghz and 2.4Ghz frequency.

Overall these 4 external long antennas are like tusks of elephant. Just for show not of much use. Buy this only for great 5Ghz performance of your fiber plans. But alas! these 5Ghz routers range is quite lower than 2.4Ghz. I suggest 5Ghz extenders for more range.",2
The product was working fine after 28 days ..the product stopped working ....and though it has 3 years warranty....they don't have customer service in Andhra Pradesh...they asked me to courier to Maharashtra out of pockets expense .....post the courier they said they will check the product and assess it only then they will replace the product.....by which time I would bought a new one and carry one with my task....don't buy this product of you are from Andhra Pradesh and or check if tplonk has after sales service there ...zero star for a nonsense aftersales service,1
"Mobile app is self explanatory and easy to configure the router. I have encountered a weird issue of bad signal and intermittent signal drop on 2.4 Ghz band just in a month after the purchase. It was a kind of disappointing to see a defective product. The service center was another disappointment. As per Tp-Link portal, they are working on all days Mon-Sat until 6PM except public holidays. But they were closed @ 5PM on a saturday which was not a public holiday @chennai service center.
Second visit they took my router for replacement and they it would take a month to get the replacement. That was the horrible part. I don't see that as a fair turnaround time for a customer who paid the product and now had to wait for a month without a router. That gives a feedback as poor customer care for TP-Link. I had used a Mi router in the past. I had intermittent disconnection issue, and they replaced it immediately. TP-Link has to seriously focus on the after sales part to gain customer confidence. Hope someone would read this to make betterment for the customers :-)",3
"On paper, yes it seems like a perfect choice for the specs it provides but idk if it's the hardware or the driver that simply don't deliver.

I had my device tested and i'm sure that 5GHz range is way lower than it should be at this price point. (I did compare it with Tenda, D Link Routers)

Bandwidth management would be the worst one that i have ever seen (i have even used 500 rupee Tenda Routers).

It randomly resets at its own ease, the protocol of this router suggest to cut off the data packets if the signal is poor, so not recommended for gaming.

Pleanty of Double NAT issues so Not suitable for gaming, only One UDP protocol suite is allowed so if you have a wireless printer, xbox one x or Internet of Things caple devices with you, choose your favourite one because at a time only one can work. (I'm honestly impressed with Asus and the capabilities of their routers but then their price :) ).

As far as the compamy is concerned - NOT SATISFIED.",1
"Overpriced and overrated as a router - it is okay - does the job, and offers you speed upto 50mbps - maybe 60 even - chops off higher bandwidth - does not have great range. If you have a house with a central room which is close to all other rooms (more or less) it works fine - if you have a bit more than 40ft+ long laid out house with rooms in a line behind each other, then expct to use signal amplifiers or extra routers.
The dlink routers do a much better job. If you are investing in a router for 2-3 years, i suggest that you upgrade and buy a higher range/higher bandwidth one. If you are looking for something to work in the 50mbps range with range less than 30 ft, then cheaper routers from netgear/even tplink do the job just as well.
It is however reliable and does not drop signal frequently even after 2 years of continuous use. It doesn't get overheated like cheaper routers.",1
"Pros
1) You can configure simpler things via phone app remotely
2) You can easily configure it
3) You can use it as a repeater by connecting to other router via wire (not wirelessly) - WDS is not there

Cons
1) Range is very bad, except if you have single floor configuration , for multiple floor houses.. its not a good option. few walls destruct the signal like anything",2
"I bought the TP-Link Archer C1200 Gigabit Wireless router from Amazon in Sept 2018. I am a computer engineer and an avid internet shopper and obsessive researcher before buying any product. After much deliberations and internet reviews, i bought this router thinking it is a great value for money. But i have to say that this is the worst modem i have invested in over 20 years. The range does not even cover 15 ft and 1 wall into my room. i have tried several settings and changes but nothing has worked. The range on this is worse than some of the cheaper made in India models. I now regret not buying the Indian brands and for think of TP-Link products as superior.",1
"Some of you may feel it's a good router comparing the weight of price to features to other products, but this is nothing but absolute deception on the part of TP-Link. These are the things you need to know:
1) This product is over 3 years old, why does it matter? Continue reading...
2) The 2.4Ghz band (which is probably the MAIN band used by most of your devices) drops almost every 3-4 hours.
3) The only way to fix this is to power reboot the router every time it happens, and a reboot takes AT LEAST 3 minutes.
4) There is ABSOLUTELY NO SUPPORT by TP-Link whatsoever.
5) The kicker? This problem has not been patched in over 3 years since it was released, and they continue to sell a defective router.

Hundreds of people have the same problem, and you can read more about it on their support forums. Amazon doesn't allow external links in reviews, but just a quick Google search will show thousands of people with the same issue. Here's one on Amazon itself:
https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R357OFFKHC6RA5/

I have tried every solution possible through settings and hardware adjustments that I could try. There is no fix other than them fixing it on their own through a patch or by replacing the defective hardware itself.

I even replaced it thinking it may be a problem with that particular model (even though all evidence pointed otherwise), but no, it's a proper defect.

Absolutely stay away from this product if you can.",1
Good. But it is not taking the default password to configure the device. I am unable to reset the device. It is not working. After calling TP-link customer care they are telling that no executive will come and fix it. They are simply telling that I need to take it to the service station. Not satisfied with Customer service.,3
"Its been close to 6 months of use and by far this is the worst router I have ever used.

Am not going to cover what speeds it does et al. Nearly all reviews talk about that.

1) You can not save your internet login credentials. My previous Jurassic-era router, DLINK DIR615 could do that. Those using ACT broadband might relate. This is an absolute nightmare for multiple devices connected to this router. Turn it off for 24 hours when not in use. You won't be able to get back online. I have 3 mobile devices, 1 tablet and a smart telly. To get online I need to turn off Wi-Fi on all devices just to grab the ACT login page (which ends on my TV and go through the painful process of entering lengthy credentials using a TV remote)

2) Signal can't go beyond couple of rooms. My work laptop detects my neighbour's Wi-Fi which is several walls and 30ft away. You need to pick your laptop and poke the router just to get it connected.

3) 5ghz antenna failed within 4 months of usage.

4) Bootup time is painfully slow, never faced this with my old router.

Overall, if you are in a situation as mine, avoid buying this router and save yourself from having a harrowing time with this.",1
"1) V3 model received instead of V2, that is okay but V3 has a rough pattern that attracts dust and cannot be cleaned easily.
2) Auto switching between 2.4GHZ and 5GHZ networks, you don't have to do it manually, is an excellent feature.
3) Very poor range of 5Ghz, router switches to lower frequency as soon as u step more than 10 feet away, speed on 2.4Ghz is slower than my last 2.4Ghz TP Link router and this sucks.
4) TP link has updated OS for V3 routers and it is good looking but not very functional.",3
"If you're lucky, you may get a product that works well for a long time. If you fall in that category, you're good, the product is good and very cost effective (however, if it's a lemon that you get, then its expensive).

I faced a frequent disconnection issue, and I have tried everything that was listed online. Factory reset, changing channel, update firmware (not too many of them BTW).

So, in the middle of the pandemic, the router gives this issue of frequent disconnection, which I thought was the issue with the ISP (turned out it was TP-Link). After mentioning this to the TP-Link support, they agreed to take the device to check if it has any issue/ honor warranty. But since it was pandemic days, I couldn't deliver it to the dealer who was located away, nor would the person entertain the request. By this time, weeks passed by and I lost the opportunity to get it RMA/ Repaired.

That Tp-Link would not entertain a support extension in itself was bad (I could only do it after much persuasion). Certainly bad policy from the company that sells truckloads of Routers.

All this has left me disillusioned. Not buying anymore Tp-Link products.",3
"After setting it up for the first time I experience that all my applications on TV and mobile and PC are facing slow internet. I googled and find that it needs to factory reset and setup again, did the same and since then it is working fine. But still not confident enough that it would not create any issue at any moment of time.",3
"This review is after 6 months of usage. My primary requirement of purchasing this product is use it with 4G dongle but that did not served my purpose. 4G dongle will not work with this device and I also found hard time using it as extender, it is conflicting with my existing router and causing network interruption to my base router. On flipside the device has great performance as access point. It easily identifies the existing networks and connects to it instantaneously.

It is bit over priced and if you want to extend existing wifi and create new network then you can go for it.",3
"Writing after 3 weeks. Unfortunately return window gone.
Takes long time to start the wifi, 1 min to start that too after Updating firmware.
Few times post power failure/ fluctuations, it stoped working, needed to press the reset button on back of device.
Needs to login to the ISP portal e.g. ACT to start the internet. Atleast happening with me after 3-4 days.",2
"not able to get the wifi in everywhere in my house, we purchase for 2000 ft house.

did not meet our expectation. When I approach to get this replaced with another router with the different specification having 9DBI. I was refused and told that you will receive the same product as a replacement. It Was really sad to get the answer from Amazon customer care which have surprised me. Be careful when the product has given option replacement means you will get the same product as a replacement else you have to leave with the product which you are not satisfied. I was extremely dissatisfied with the product and policy of Amazon.",1
"Purchased this wifi router as my current 3 year old D-link modem/router wasnt providing me enough wifi coverage in my new house. i needed better coverage and speed all across my 2bhk home (which is by no means large).

What i observed is that there was neither any increase in speed nor improvement in coverage. Infact wifi signal drops are now more frequent which even my wifi has noticed. My PC, which is hardly 5 feet from this wifi router is now dependant on a wired ethernet connection, the wifi signal is so poor and unreliable.
Called the customer care, and he too sounded like....""you should have asked before buying this wifi router""
I am looking at how do return this product and get my money back. Considering my experience, i suspect if all the other reviews for this product are genuine.

update:
even the wired connection is so poor that i get good internet speed from a direct cable connection from my modem , but no internet connection from the router which is connected to my modem",1
"Received the product on time. Thanks Amazon for timely delivery but the product has left at security guard without any information.
The installation is very easy and I could connect it with help of my internet service provider. As mentioned by TP link about the wider coverage I could not found much difference as compared to my Older Miwifi 3C router. TP link is slightly better but the cost difference between those two is huge. Earlier I used to found one bedroom of my home is facing the connection issue due to wall now also I am facing the same issue because of which I have to start using my old router in repeater mode. I found slight improvement in lag time of my devices. Also the buffering is lower while I watch TV.
The app is very easy to use and I can control the router through app this is an advantage over Miwifi. Miwifi app is very worst and useless.
Overall it is OK purchase for me.",3

"The devices have serious issues with their firmware. The internet speed over LAN and WIFI drop to less than a quarter of total speed and this is frequent. Changing the firmware to old version solves the issue for sometime but again the internet drops and constant followup with customer care makes you feel that buying this was a bad choice. Recently the whole tp link forum is flooded with internet speed deteriorating issues. I would strongly recommend a different brand. This is the 3rd time in 6 months, like how many times do you want to reset the device, change firmwares and keep contacting the customercare.",1
"This router is very good i liked it alot in speed,looks and UI. but its range is like shit i compared it with my old single antenna router and i am amazed that it can't even beat a 4 years old single antenna router in range. my routers are in my room i live in 2nd floor and my main router can reach 1st and 3rd floors with a very little signal so i bought this but it cant even cover whole floor i am not getting signals on other floors thats why i refunded it.",3
"ISP- You Broadband
Plan- 150 Mbps

Netflix and YouTube work very well on this router. But for some reason, browsing experience is very poor. Website liked Wikipedia, New York Times, Etc take extremely long to load.
Speed Test shows good speed and Ping.
But it does not reflect in the user experience. Even GTA 5 is not able to connect to Rockstar Games Service/Social Club.
Very disappointed with the product.",1
"The wifi range is lesser than my 2 antena ZTE Wifi router which I got it for free with My ISP. I don‚Äôt understand what is the use of 4 external antennas and one internal , may be just for show. If you want to upgrade for range this is not at all a good option.
The 5G band is the only upgrade I got, but the range is so bad for 5G . Just inside the room.
If you have an Internet connection with more than 50 mbps then only 5G band is of any use.
Amazon delivery packing and everything was very good.",3
"Not tested on high speed connection, but working well for my 10mbps connection. Also supporting 8-10 devices at a time.
Only grudge is wall and metal door penetration of signals is poor. Can't even cover 10 feet after metal door.
Used dlink router before which was giving aroud 20 feet range after closing metal door.
Overall good for indoor but signal range severely limited by walls and doors.",3
"Archer-5 has a much better feature than Archer-6. Apart from the additional internal antenna which is not visible the feature set are very poor.

After a long wait got an engineer on call.. Had to explain multiple times about the feature.. The engineer kept arguing the interface grouping is not available on Archer-5 too while i have been using that feature.

I was supposed to get an call back in 8 hours after consulting there engineering team, its been more than 4 days.. still no response",1
not nice i return in game pc lagg & i purchased archer A6 is totally different it has no issues it has newer Qualcomm QCA9886 chipset you must go with a6 it has more 5ghz channel s 36to161 & c6 has 36to46 5hz channel s Qualcomm Atheros QCA9563chipset it is old c6,1
"Completely Misleading product - Reviews and Ratings !!
Product is so called Travel Router, but ratings and reviews are of different product.
1) This Dongle needs a consistent power source, No Internal Battery and NO YOU CANNOT CARRY THIS IS YOUR POCKET UNTIL YOU CAN POWER IT while you walk !
2) This product needs a Wifi Source or LAN Cable - again you CANNOT CARRY THIS IN YOUR POCKET Until you have a LAN Socket on you while on the GO
3) This product will work only with a particular model of Huawei dongle if you plan to use it with USB Slot - Dongles like Airtel Etc are by Huawei but its is not compatible with this product - ( I tried failed - and the same was validated by TB Customercare Exe)",1
I bought this product on 25th October 2020. It stopped working from 20 December 2020. I called customer service and they asked me to arrange another adapter from any electronic shop. I refused to do due to busy schedule and asked the service executive to send a technician as the product illustrates 3 years of warranty. But the technical executive said they can't help anymore. Why the hell this company promising 3 years of warranty when they can't fullfill. Waste of money on this REDICULOUS product,1
"Had brought this router thinking it would be great addition to my house, but as it turns out, someone has tampered with it. Since it is a dual band(2.4 GHz and 5 GHz) I was expecting the same but the 5 GHz frequency wasn't operating. The password printed on the back of the router didn't match when I tried to login, had a very harrowing experience.

Had to manually reset it twice only then it worked.

Buyer beware!",1
"Like any other Indian buyer, I was swayed away by following
- Cost ( Cheaper than its competitors )
- Looks ( 4 Antennas give a impression that its super strong)
- Product Reviews ( 6000 reviews, mostly 5 or 4 star)

Reality:
Looks are deceptive - These 4 antenna are just for show-off, I think there‚Äôs only one internal antenna that really works. Even if you remove other 3 antennas the signal strength remains the same.

Usefull - Naah.. my problem still remains, this Router is no better then D-Link 600 that I had earlier. Not a single bit improvement in the Wifi signal that I use to get in my house with D-Link.

Cost - I think people should not fell for Cost, a slightly costly one from Netgear is far superior than this toy. I borrowed a netgear router from my friend it worked like a charm and gave me far superior performance. I‚Äôm selling it on Olx, and will get a Netgear now.

Ratings: I think these user reviews are biased and manipulated within legal framework. As these are not audited by any 3rd party company. If you need to buy any product from amazon, then please check review and ratings of the product outside on other 3rd party websites. It will help.
Happy to answer any question if you guys may have.",1
Very pathetic support. Product is having some manufacturing defects and last two months I am trying to get a replacement. If I call customer care they are just asking us to contact the local service centre. But they are not even responding or attending calls. I do not recommend this product to anyone. please do not be fooled by buying the TP Link product.,1
The item sent was archer c6 MU-MIMO which is a less priced router. With the model it's hard to guess any difference but they both are priced differently and the item sent was of lower price. Amazon need to reduce these types of cheating and I can see from the product review provided by other customers that many of them have been cheated.,1
"Consider buying another brand router. The 2.4Ghz WiFi band has a lot of signal drops and issues. Multiple firmware upgrades later it still exists. You can search it up on the TP-link forums. 2.4Ghz SSID just dissappears or you just can't connect to it, ip conflicts in DHCP mode and only solution is to restart the router again and again. Really frustrating!

That being said the 5Ghz band works consistently without any issues.

Also point to note is that even though this device supports One Mesh it doesn't mean you can buy another Archer C6 router and set up a mesh network. Read up more on it if that's your plan.",2
"The product description is wrongly mentioned as hotspot, as in a point where SIM can be inserted. This is a Router not a hotspot. Basically a hotspot is a self sufficient unit which can directly connect to the internet. This is not such a device. It can only connect to a hotspot or a Access point via wifi or RJ45 for internet access.",1
"Writing this after using this product for 1 month and already replacing one back.

Good
1 - The 2.4 GHz band has a good range, will cover nook and corner of your home.
2 - The device build quality is good, not heating up too much
3 - Provides good speed from your internet connection

Bad
1 - Here the problems start, you can't rely on the 2.4 GHz band, the device drops connections multiple times a day when connected to this band, and will show that there is no internet. But the 5GHz band will be working normally at the same time. I tried replacing the first Router that I bought but the second one is also showcasing the same problem
2 - 5 GHz band which works properly has very less range, don't expect anything solid beyond one wall.
3 - The advertised Mu-Mimo tech is not visible or prominent even when used with set preference, so that seems like just a gimmick.
4 - The smart switch feature available is also not that smart, it will not switch your device to the 5Ghz network when the 2.4 GHz networks stop working as I mentioned above.

If the situation is getting verse I might switch back to my NetGear router which was more reliable even though it is old and only supports 2.4 GHz band.",3
"Signal - Excellent.
Setup- Not painful.
Looks - Big but good.

At idle, this router is very warm. This was placed on a flat table which is anything but crowded with no obstructions for airflow. The underside was close to hot and the top panel was very warm. Yet, signal was excellent and stable during these 30 C days in south India. However, heat is a very big concern for life of any electronics and add to that the average maximum temperatures in Summer which crossed 40C. I'm sure, it will have some kind of impact on signal stability and over-all life of this product. Got a replacement which had same issue, so I think it is a design limitation rather than unit defect. So, I guess, unless you have air conditioned rooms where you can install this, you may want to get something else doesn't heat up as much. I have read multiple reviews of products in this price range and except Netgear and Dlink 825 don't seem to have heat complaint. So, choose wisely and I hope we get better choices in this price range.",3
"The router has a very good build quality and UI.
USB Port works as intended.
I'm disappointed with 2.4ghz speeds. It maxes out at 42mbps download. But Upload is good.
The range is ok not that impressive. just a bit better than TP-Link TR841n. If you have the latter one, don't upgrade if u want 2.4 GHz one.
Coming to the 5GHz network, the range is good for its frequency but you should be in the same room to use its full bandwidth.
This router is not made to share wifi between different floors. You will not get signals above or below its altitude.
This router has Remote access controls which I like very much.
This router is not best in anything. Maybe I should have gone with Archer c6 router(Same price - 4 antennas)",3
"Overall product is decent only, 5Ghz coverage is below my expectation though performance within the range is good. The other 2.4 Ghz band can not reach beyond 2 walls or barely reaches in best possible condition. I need to reboot the router every 2-3 days to work. The Biggest letdown with this router is NO bandwidth control option!! I was looking for my first dual band router for my FTTH connection and after researching on Internet and YouTuber's recommendation I bought this one. Initial setup and other things are good. mobile app provides easy access to router setting, this all good but NO Bandwidth control, I'M regretting my purchase. I would say it is just overhyped router..",3
"Recently bought the TP Link Archer C6(US) Hardware version 3.2. This router is good when you consider the speed alone. Wifi devices configured in this router loose the internet connection at random time, and to regain the internet you have to restart the router. Interesting thing is that your device 1 may be working fine with internet connectivity but at the same time device2 shows no internet. This is discussed extensively in the TP Link forum in this header ""Archer c6 ""no internet access"" and sometime not connecting to the wifi saying ""limited connection"". Seems to be a firmware issue, but loosing the internet connection in middle of an office call is not a good choice (with the fact that the internet connection is still present but the router just denied it for some of the wifi clients)",1
 Have received a older version of router. The shown in images is the latest one. The seller has shown the wrong image.,3
"In 1 month the router stopped working after the continuous call center team responded with service center details. Courrier charges have to be paid by me but after 4 days I received a refurbished product instead it should be replaced with a new one or the old product should be repaired and should have sent to me.
Very disappointed with the TP-LINK service center and customer service.",2
"This router always emits some heat even when no one is actively downloading files, just surfing the net. I'm a bit disappointed.

Apart from the heating issue, this router is easy to set up, and the range is good enough. 5G gives me 100% of what my ISP delivered, so I have no complaint about the abilities department.",3
"Over all the device is good. It delivers the speed that it advertises however there is a major flaw.
There is not option to limit the bandwidth for a device. You cannot even limit the bandwidth for guest network.
I am on V2 of firmware. Hopefully some future update can add this feature. My old Rs1000 Mi router had these features.",3
"I replaced my basic TP-Link 720N [worth of 700 INR] with this router, thinking it would improve Wi-Fi speed and range with MU-MIMO and dual-band support, however, I don't feel much difference between my previous router [which as internal antenna] with these Hitec 4 long-standing antennas.

I had a weak signal at corner of my hall with my previous router, thought this will solve that problem but of no change. Disappointed with this purchase. :-|",3
"Not so easy to install.
Unresolved problem with 2.4 ghz connecting.
5 ghz frequency works fine.
Take 5 min to reconnect to internet after every restart in case of power cut.
Device range is solid.
But you will not be able to connect your Sharry tv (which supports 2.4 ghz) or ps/ xbox.

Ultra poor tech support.
So you are on your own.
No firmware updates.

If you are a networking expert, then pls go for it & help the society by making patch for 2.4 ghz problem.",1
"I really do not understand why there is no return option rather it is a replacement option. It is hardly not even 3 weeks and the router is getting frequently restarted. Daily it restarts 5-6 times without anything and it creates problems in my daily meetings/work, childs daily school due to disconnection issues. Luckily I had my old router so my work and other things are not disturbed else due to this replacement policy it would have impacted me a lot. Ideally replacement policy should be like take back old and deliver new at the same time so it doesn't impact people specially in this current situation where everything is work frm home and online
Also the range is very less. I have the router in my hall of 950sq.ft home and there is no range in any of my bedrooms which is about 20-25 feets of distance. Really not at happy as of now.",1
"My 10 Year old Netgear N300 still works like a charm! and has almost same range as this router (TP-Link Archer C7 AC1750 Dual Band Gigabit Wireless Cable Router). I purchased it expecting a better coverage in my medium sized home (1100 sq ft).

I live in a duplex home. The wifi coverage on the ground floor is same for both routers. However in one room on the first floor (above ground floor) the signal is very weak. With this purchase I was expecting a better wifi coverage on the first floor but I'm left disappointed as its just as good as my 10 Year old Netgear N300.

My only hope is when I upgrade my internet connection from 50 mbps to 100 mbps this new router would be compatible and do justice to the speed.

If you are looking for coverage on 2 floors in a medium sized home (1100 sq ft) this router may not be a good choice. Its maximum range is 2 floors, 2200 sq ft (1100 sq ft + 1100 sq ft). So if you need decent coverage you may have to spend some more money on a better router.

Some plus points now..

1) Super easy to setup (I have a PPPoe connection with ACT)
2) Network storage (1 usb)
3) Easy management with Tether app.
4) This router say's mesh ready (I haven't tried it yet)",3
"I ordered the Archer C6 and the first one that was delivered would not connect to PPPoE connection.
Returned it and got a replacement from Amazon promptly.
The second one connected to my PPPoE connection and was able to use it.
A little background on my requirements.
I have a Mi 3C router that has excellent range. I get good powerful wifi signals across the entire two storey bungalow and surroundings. The only problem was when more than 5 devices connected the wifi would start disconnecting on some devices.
I wanted to purchase a router that would provide good range but also maintain connections.
The Archer c6 was available at a good price and having used TPLink routers before I ordered this one expecting the same.
The wifi range is not great and across walls the signal is not as strong and in some places in the house I started getting dead spots.
The wifi is good within the same room or across windows but not across walls.
The tplink feature of smart connect that switches between 5G and 2.4G signal automatically is actually a pain.
Had to return it as it didn't serve my purpose.
Ordered a Linksys E5600 instead and it's working quite well.

Pros
- Price
- MI-MIMO
- Qualcomm CPU
- OneMesh support (for Mesh network setup)
- Good mobile app support

Cons
- Connecting to PPPoE networks is a hit or miss
- WiFi range is not great across walls. Don't order if you wish to use across multiple walls.
- Smart Connect feature is sometimes a pain as it tries to connect to a weaker signal and keeps frequently disconnecting.",2
"I was hoping that this routers range would extend far beyond my 10 year old belkin router that I was using, but that is not the case. In an open area this router has a good range but when it has to pass through walls the range is same as my old belkin router. If there is only 1 wall to pass through, the router is able to accomplish that but if it has to pass through 2 walls in case of multiple rooms then the network strength is very low.

Pros:
The router provides good download and upload speeds. No complaints there.
Looks good and is compact and lightweight.

Ethernet Cable and power adapter are included. Set up is easy.",3
"I bought it for 2reason.
Good signal and parental control in mob App.
But very sorry to inform you that the 5g signal at 10 meter distance reduces.. and the parental control does not work..

Why the parental control is not working in this app...if you wish to support, call me back or send your technician.",1
Not as fast as it claims. I use mi router before this but after installing this i find less wifi coverage as compared to 4 times cheaper router then this. No improvement in wifi signal or connection speed. It does not have MU-MIMO which is latest technology in routers. Also usb is 2.0 and dies not worked with my Apple devices. Not a user friendly storage system. You have to be a advance user to use this function. Y,3
"The router is okay and works perfectly fine . Except the title at some point suggesting it supports beam foaming which it doesn't and then they sent a router that was used and not a new one.

How do I know it is used
- one all the packaging inside was off
- the router had a personalized name for which I had to do a hard reset before I could start using

Now Amazon won't return it and would only replace it which doesn't work obviously.",3
"I would strongly suggest not to Buy this router model Archer C6 (EU), V2. Stick to more established vendors and models.
here are my observations (only cons)
1. Very frequent disconnects. unless the router is rebooted, the client cannot connect again. i need to reboot router atleast 2-3 daily and it severely impacts my WFH.
2. despite implementing all suggestions by TPLink (some of them non standard and raises doubts if you are a networking guy) the issue remains unresolved till date
3. TP link support do not have clue on resolution, their forum is full of this issue. emails and support calls (which I been following up daily since last one month) has not given any hope of resolution. TP Link India support phone disconnects very frequently.
Wonder how TPLink has released this model without necessary testing and fixing bugs. This Model is a waste of Money.. Please read all recent reviews and posts before you buy..

Update On 16-03-2021
Updated the firmware of the router to beta version as recommended by their support. The firmware has not resolved the problem but rather restricts/throttles the upload speed by more than 50%, making playing games on PS4 a buffering experience and disconnects on 2.4 GHZ continues. surprisingly the log does not mention any critical alerts that the router has stopped responding. I have switched back to my old trusted D-Link rotuer DIR-850L. Also note for RMA, TP link does not provide home pickup, their support centers are very few and may need few Hrs of travel and returning the product, requires you to be bear one way cost. My recommendations given earlier still stands- Stay Away",1
"Worst experience. The way it was delivered was like repacked. Package was crushed.

Router:
Not that great. Speed wise it was ok.. WiFi range same as my old router.
Media server is one of my priority. It was worst experience. All folder names Appear as ""Null"".
Thanks to Amazon for accepting my refund request.
Bought Asus. Awesome XP comparatively. Ofcourse price is more but penny vise is an investment!",2
"Bit slow than my previous router. No bandwidth control available. Where other routers have this feature where my Rs 799 router has this feature. As per the support team, they mentioned that this feature is not available in TP link. The 2.4 ghz not working properly. After every 2 hour I have to restart the router to work 2.4ghz properly.

Apart from that the admin panel is not well described. Bit alow when changing some settings. And it has only replacement policy not return is applicable. Waster Rs. 2.5K on bad router. Also, speed getting dropped for continuous using. The CPU is getting high when more than 6 device are connected. Better to go with other router. I thought I'll buy AC-4000, but thank God that I bought cheaper one to get know about its inner side. Never ever again will go for TP Link. üòüüò≠üòî",1
"Getting amazing speed with this router (200 mpbs for my 200 mbps connection. Range is amazing too (covers around 1000 sq. ft. easily).

The only problem is, the router has started to restart itself frequently.. (sometimes 5-6 times at a go) which is very irritating. I have followed instructions read online, which talk about firmware update, and when checked, I found the firmware to be in the latest version.

May be voltage fluctuations are causing this, so investing more money to get a UPS for this now..",1
"Not sure weather I will be able to use the MIMO feature with required compatible devices but now I think the Rs1900 tp link version would have been fine as well for me instead of this Rs2600 TP link router.

Network coverage is poor as i am not getting network in the areas where I used to get previously with also an old TP link router.

I would recommend going for Rs1900 version which has same features as this one except MIMO which is of no use of us anyways.",3
"The Wifi signal gets jumbled up beyond 10 feet... The Irritating Smart Connect feature can't decide whether it wants 2.4G or 5G channel for your system which you are using...
AI is a bummer....
Tech support is non existent, found much better answers on Reddit....
Although the Tether App makes it easy to install...

Btw I bought Ver 2... Received Ver 3... Although both connect to RJ45... I guess Amazon forgot to update the little detail... Also delivery was in 1 day... Which is good... But 3PL distributor thought the Packaging can withstand a pounding by Godzilla, so received the out box banged up in some places...

Pro Tip: If you want good wifi stability, choose any one band either 2.4G or 5G otherwise, the router will start thinking it's Skynet and mess you up...",2
"Was getting heated up and reseted frequently.
Returned it.
Got return promptly, thanks",1
"The router is good, but it takes hell lot of time to start. First , I though that I received a faulty one as it taking hell lot of time to start.

Got this after so many positive reviews, which seems very no no for me. Will seek customer support help if any issue arises in this faulty device.",1
"the signal strength is very bad. the 5ghz does not connect after 10 feet.
and the 2.4 ghz does not receive half the signal strentgh of my earlier tp-link.
clearly something wrong with the piece.",1
"There is nothing great about this product. I upgraded from TP link wr41n and believe me there is no increase in the wifi signal coverage at all. Although I must say the 5g speed is a charm but the vicinity is too small. The usb port and connectivity is outdated. You need to tweak windows machine to support it. Ipad would not accept it at all, directing to buy a paid third party software. If you are looking buy this for USB Nas, I would suggest buy a separate wireless usb hub instead.
One more interesting observation, when you have one or two signal bar, the internet would not work at all.",2
"After using it for a month, I'll write my honest review, I ordered it a month ago, everything seemed fine, except for one problem (keep on reading), I thought this particular piece is faulty, and since there was no return option and it could only be replaced, I ordered a replacement, within 2-3 days I got a fresh new piece.

But, same problem again, the problem in both the routers is that it loses 2.4Ghz channel while the 5Ghz channel is happily running, so there was obviously nothing wrong in my Internet connection, all of a sudden you'd lose Internet, while my Android TV which is connected to 5G band is going on smoothly, after some research, I saw a few articles which said that if there are a lot of wifi networks around your wifi then sometimes due to interference you can lose this channel. however, I never faced this problem in my old Netgear router. I tried all suggested workarounds but the problem continued in my original router as well as in the replacement that I got.

So, I'm living with this problem, thankfully it's not very painful, so far what I've observed is that you lose Internet once in two days, then you've to restart the router and it continues nicely. I'll rate the main features separately below.

2.4 Ghz Channel - 6 out of 10, only reason is because it loses Internet all of a sudden, but it covers an amazing distance, I've a 1600SFT apartment and it covers corner to corner.

5G Channel - you can reach upto 100MB/s easily, distance covered is half or perhaps less than 2.5Ghz channel.

Looks - didn't matter much, but looks good.

Setup - Super easy,

Price - reasonable

Area coverage - for me , the 2.5Ghz covers more area than I needed, if you live in a bigger house then not sure",3
"Under 2500 best router tplink

Bought the AC1200 in July.2020 and it has already stopped working. Only the power LED comes on and the 2.4 and 5 ghz have stopped working. Which mean it cannot transmit the signal. All suggested solutions have been tried. Helpline numbers nobody responds and i am now sitting with a DUD router. 1 year warranty but who do i call to replace with ?? If anybody can help pls.,1
"The WiFi range of the device which I got is very less,
in picture in green color TP-Link_5GHz is my old tplink router Archer C20I without any antennas.
In purple color TP-Link_712C_5G is new Archer C1200 see the range even with three external antennas its signal strength is same, my purpose is not solved

2. I got a returned / used product bcz I see default password is changed, product is delivered without checking its condition.

I want to have refund in case if the replaced device also gives the same range",2
"Purchase few days ago...
Received Old firmware product.
But on Amazon clearly mention EU v2
I have alliance Broadband 60mbps connection
Before update facing connection issue with avarage speed after update ( EUv2) face same connection issue with low speed...
With avarage range...
Use only 2.4 ghz",2
Bought this router and 60 days agoa and now I see that the 5Ghz does not work at all. Raised a ticket with suport but they were not able to fix it remotely. Now the challenge is to get a replacement. I am asked to go to the service center which is 26Km far and get it checked by a technical person and they only work 3 days a week. So if I have to get the router repaired or replaced I have to apply for leave for one day. This is seriously bad service.,1
I have used this router only for 8 months. After which it stoped working. But they aint ready to replace inspite of having 3 years of warranty and they have ample of excuses and reasons the customer service is even more pathetic. Since past 2 months when ever i call. They just keep telling me. Sir plz reset the router.,1
"The wifi speed was very slow compared to what they claim it to be from the very first day.

The previous TP-Link router (TP-Link Archer C20 AC750) I had was faster but had to throw away that because the ports stopped working after about a year of usage.

Now in this router, the internet port and ethernet port stopped working in 10 days.
It is no longer recognizing any internet connectivity even if it is connected due to which wifi connection isn't working as well.

It's been more than 10 days and I'm not able to return it too. Will never recommend this product to anyone.",1
"Review on day 1 and related to setup. The app is a convenient way of setting the router up, I set it up with a static IP and all went fine.
Then came the step where I could rename the router and change its default password. No matter how many times I tried this, once the router restarts (after confirming the settings) my phone (iPhone) won't connect to the router! So I ended up with the default router name and password!
Other than that, the router gets quite warm during operation. And the 5G signal has a very limited reach.",1
"2.4 ghz keeps on disconnecting.
5 ghz is stable but can be used only in room where router is kept as it has limited range.
Solution - create a guest network for 2.4ghz and post that disconnection problem solves
Update - 2.4ghz network not having good range and it's weak comapred to even 5ghz.
Called TP Link tech support several times and even they can't sort out the issue. Tried changing channel's, reset, and other stuff but still range issues
Have to retun it for the same reason",1
"I got it and for 3 months it was ok

It prompted for a upgrade of the version of the firmare - i made an mistake of accepting it.

Post that wifi will would randomly go off - worst case it is very well known issue but the customer support wont' accept it( I was fighting with my ISP, and took me two weeks to proove it a router issue ) . Worst of all it can't downgrade /reverse the installation and you are struck. In the web it was suggest going to another firmware( which is very technically complex to install + you will loose your warranty). They promise future versions will fix the bug but it still doesnt'. My router is a table weight now.

Calls to customer support will never be picked up - I had once tried even for 1/2 hour !
Emails to customer support will solicit the same information again and again - they respond every 4 or 5 days !
Finally they refer to service centre - who works only 4 hour , 3 days a week - Mon, wed and friday ! Designed to ensure that you won't visit !

I haven't seen such a post support issues/buggy software ever !",1
"Averall its ok but
Wifi coverage is poor ..very poor
My dlink 2750U has better wifi range then this router...just to give an idea
My router is in store room 10 meters is my bed from its location ..i get 2 signals in 3 ghz option
And 1 signal in 5 ghz
Earlier on i gave it 3 stars but after using for 6 months now i will give 2 stars that too for its ios application
Dont Buy waste of money ...look for other good options",2
"It works great if there is no walls! But if u have 1 wall 5 GHz! Signal strength will reduce to 50%‚¨áÔ∏è and 2.5ghz! To 75% ‚¨áÔ∏è

If it is near to router without anywall! 5ghz is a charm! ‚ù§Ô∏è
BETTER PURCHASE D-LINK! it's great! Comparatively",2
Product does not have on site warranty so purchase it on your own risk i bought it in Feb 2020 and it got fault in May 2020 when contacted for warranty they responded sorry no on site warranty so its up to you now to buy Tp link router or not mine personal experience after sale support is more important,1
"One year and 4 months and it stopped working. It restarts again and again every 15 seconds even before it completely boots up. Completely unusable. I thought the problem might be with the adapter, but then I tested the power adapter with another router of same rating and it works. So the problem is definitely with the router.",2
"First of all, this is not an ADSL router so you cannot connect it directly using your RJ11 phone line. It's my error that I did not pay attention while buying.
I therefore connected it using my BSNL modem via LAN.
However due to my utter dismay, the internet connection drops at regular intervals causing frustration especially while playing online games. There is a consistent drop in internet speed as well. My old BSNL WiFi modem which is 10 year old is doing a better job.
A big thumbs down to tplink.",1
"Reviewing after 8 9 months of use.
I have a gigabit ethernet connection, but still it only supports 300 Mbps only on 5G WiFi band(Not mentioned on the box) and on 2.4ghz it only gives out 50 Mbps max. Don't go for it thinking it will serve you good.
1. Reboot takes more than 3 4 mins.
2. Need to schedule a reboot schedule as on Pppoe connection it gives out errors in every 2 3 days.
3. Even when ipv4 connection is established, it will not allow the internet to pass through neither on WiFi nor on Lan.( You need multiple restarts)
4. Range is Just adequate for a 2 floored house. But still I had to get another cheap router for my other floor.
5. Gigabit Ethernet works fine.
6. It has issues on 2.4ghz with ping. Ex- if I am getting 2 ms ping on Lan, on 2.4 GHz band it would be around 15 ms.

Verdict
Value for money 6/10
Performance 4/10

If you can afford to buy a router from ASUS or NETGEAR ,then only buy them I still have 6 7 year old Asus and Netgear which just work flawlessly.",2
"Keeps disconnecting from devices, especially if u switch off a device router will fail to assign an IP address to it and won't connect. Trust me I have tried all possible settings. Even called TP-LInk and applied their settings, still the same problem. It was a mistake buying this one. Buy D-link, I had no problem with that. Will have to replace this in the future.",1
" Item quality is good. But this didn't serves my purpose. I want to return this product but no support form the Amazon. There is a replacement option but no return. If you know the product then only purchase otherwise don't purchase . This product is simply lying with me. Rarely useful. Think all the available options, finally purchase. This unit heats up.",3
"Not worth spending on 5GHz Dual Band Router if you expect 5GHz over a two stories building. I hoped that the 5GH would travel atleast two floors but it works only when sitting very close proximity to it.

I would have not ordered this one had I known that the 5GHz is not strong over a distance. Would have stick to my 2.5GHz N Router.",3
"This Router will not work with every type of Internet conection or service provider, especially with dynamic IP, even thought it says it does. After two hours of very helpful support from TP link even they suggested I return the router and keep my D Link. I live in Mumbai and have a high speed, 100mps, with Spectranet even my service provided advised me to return the product and stick with Dlink. Unfortunate as I heard great things about this router.",1
Well I was sceptical of the other reviews saying the device stops working after sometime . But now that my device stopped working just about 3 months i do believe it . The device wont power on at all . Changed the power adapter to no avail . Now they want me to send the device to Mumbai Serveice center by courier at my own expense to probably get a refurbished device . This is ridiculous . I suspect they are selling refurbished devices as there is no warranty sticker on the device at all .,1
"I'm not sure if it's only for my device or for all.
I see a constant drop from 150Mbps to 50 Mbps everytime. It needs resetting again and again to gain back speed.
Please consider this risk before buying. All other options (their GUI, signal strength) are working fine.",2
"I am facing some issue in my TP link router archer C6, i have contacted TP Link Customer support team, there is no much response from them, so i have approached Amazon customer support team, and informed regarding the archer C6 issue - orange light and green light is keep on changing frequently, so internet is not stable, i have contacted local ISP team as well, since they also tried the level best, so after that when i was checking on the sites like archer C6 having this common issue. So i have informed th same issue to amazon team, they have asked me to return the product, so i have returned the product and i got the refund amount also credited, within the short span of time, Thanks amazon for your continous support. anyway i wont recommend anybody to go with TP Link archer C6 router. So please dont do the same mistake whatever i have done, Thanks amazon for your continous support and cooperation.",3
"The range, the signal strength keeps fluctuating, it struggles to cross the walls. The price is exaggerated, you get this at 5500 in a local computer store. I felt disappointed when I cross-checked the price in a local computer shop, but I had already paid on Amazon so I had to leave with it.
I personally don't this it is as great as it is mentioned in the product description. definitely not worth 7k.",3
"5G is not working after the SSID changes,
After profile/connection update ,it will disconnected automatically when we have switch it off. And we have again configuration for the same, now deposit to TP link service center, they responded that their head office is closed , not sure when the product will available for replacement.
While they did not offer any alternative modem,
Wrost experience with TP link,
Plz buy any modem/router from your service provider not from outside",1
"The signal strength is strong only if we are close to the router. I have a 100 mbps connection and when I do the speed test standing next to the router its detecting 95mpbs. When I go to the next room I'm getting 45mpbs speed. I believe mu-mimo technology, the signal should be strong in other rooms of the same house.
Anyway its serving the purpose as of now.",3
"Update After more than one year of usage:

Initially I was impressed with this router but now I'm not. In fact I'm angry. This is probably the worst router I have come across. Biggest issue with this router is firmware stability. You go to any forum and search for this router, everyone is facing firmware issues. There's absolutely no support from TP Link for this router. Firmware is just pathetic. Router keeps rebooting. Random disconnections. Connection dropping. Worst latency, jerky web browsing are just some of the problems with this router. This problems are due to bad firmware support. I went with this router based on my old TP link N150 router which is rock solid even after 10 years of usage but this purchase was a mistake. Please avoid this router. Its not worth it. Better go with some other brand.

Changing the rating from 5*to 1*",1
"Very Disappointed.

TTL WR 902 AC, AC 750 Wi Fi Travel Router.

Product description says it can be used to make WPA2 Enterprise wifi as private wifi. But No support for WPA2 Enterprise PEAP. It actually can not connect to WPA2 Enterprise wifi setup.

The worst thing is their call center doesn't take the call even after even 12 rings after a long queue wait when it gets connected to representative, happened twise. They don't know hot to configure. They promised call but never called me. 3 executives disconnected the call after listening to the problem. Even after 8 calls no proper answer as they dont know about their product.

The product quality, packaging seems good. But all these are meaningless when the router is not doing what it is supposed to do. Even worst feel is their call center support. On email they never replied till date.

Only good thing is this product can be returned.",1
"What a worst thing ever. This is highly rated and doesn't even provide basic bandwidth control feature. Even guests are accessing my data at such high speeds. No limit control. Mercusys mw305r had lot of features. I'm going to return this.
No support available in India",2
"Great product....for 2 months.
Great signal coverage. I used to get signal in any corner of the house. But then suddenly it stopped working. As shown in the video the lights went dull for some reason and the device stopped working. Trying to reach tech support, but in vain.",2
"I bought this in Oct'18 and overall performance was OK. However, after 20 months, WIFI suddenly not working (unable to connect to clients most of the time, even if it connects speed drops to very low like 'single digit' mbps when my connection is 250mbps). Tried various options as suggested in TP-Link support site, but nothing worked. Surprisingly (in a bad way), I had purchases TP-Link Wifi PCIE card which also had WIFI issues within a year and I had to throw it out and purchased another vendor's WIFI card.

Very disappointed that you bought this for around INR 25K and it suddenly breaks. Its not worth to buy TP-Link products as I had two TP-Link products that had quality issues (particularly WIFI related).",1
"Amazon fooled me with all the TP-link router review in one place. Actually this device has no proper reviews or this was not used the way I am using it.

Range extender: Not recommended. This product description says, max speed for 5GH signal is 433 MBPS. When coming into reality it does not when you us it for the purpose of range extender. Its full waste of money for the extender purpose. It will not cover the range not even 100 sqft. So better buy the other model that only servers that purpose.

Now am stuck here as there is no return of this product and get fooled with the product description that it support my 300 MBPS line. Actual speed am getting when i am sitting next to that router is posted.

LAN will not re-connect when you use that one with the hot-spot. You have to re-start the modem.",1
"I was using D-Link 300mbps and had no issue. Act fiber people changed the service wire from 2pair to 4 pair and was adviced to change the route to make use of the 4pair bandwidth, speed etc.
I find the Speed to be slow. The earlier one from D-Links was faster even though it was only 300mbps. I connected my TV / Prime / Hotstar to 5G and the remaining devices ( mobiles, iPad and PC ) to the other. Still speed is slow.",3
I'm currently using a single band Mi Router since last 4 year with my 60Mbps Internet connection which gives full speed of 60Mbps without any issue. Since I'm planning to upgrade my internet to a fiber connection I Purchased 'TP-Link Archer C6'. With my surprise the speed of internet gone down to 35Mbps and frequent drop in service. So returned the product. Didn't meet my expectation.,2
" After 5 month Router is not working properly and try to contact with techsupport team no reply coming from TPlink side .
Very bad service
Please do not buy this product because when we talk about tech support from TP link its very poor .
I am humble request to all do not buy",1
"It works well, but I am not happy with the coverage range. in my 1500 sft flat I am not getting the signal in my bedroom, may be its because of the wood work in the passage. when in close proximity I am getting speeds of 80-100 MBPS consistently. long range 2.4 GHz signal strength also not good/consistent.

My main reason for buying this product is enhance/wide coverage with good speeds, but couldn't get that. May be my expectation is bit high and I might have to look for an alternative (wifi extender) solution.",3
Bought it after reading a lot of reviews. My primary requirement was good range as I live in a 3000 sq feet house (1500 x 2 floors). 5 ghz coverage is pretty good but I was disappointed with 2.4 ghz range. In some places the 5 ghz range was better than 2.4ghz range which was surprising. Setting it up was a breeze. I am using wifi extenders with this router.,3
"The product reboots randomly and the WAN port though is down, the port status is till green.
This is one of the poorest customer support I have been in contact. Raise RMA in early October and it's been a month with no support.

What's surprising is TP-Link do not have an escalation matrix and the ticket has been updated with all misleading information about them reaching out to me, which has never happened.

Though the warranty is for 3 years. Without much support or response no point having even 100 years of warranty.",1
"It's a ok ok router. I personally liked 840N from tp link from which I upgraded to this. 840N had better range despite it had only 2 antennas.

Software used was a bit of disappointment where I was not able to limit speed on each signal / network as I was able to do on 840N. Also, the processor used looked underpowered since I saw it being utilized at 70-80 ‚ÑÖ or I guess I also saw 100‚ÑÖ when the number of devices connected never reached beyond 5 / 7.

TPLink should comment as to what may have caused that spike since it's MIMU enabled for 2 devices and is one of the latest devices they have.

I am using 100 Mbps connection.",2
"This is an average dual band router with an upgraded MIMO tech. No different from most routers. Considering it‚Äôs performance, I believe it is priced slightly on a higher side. WiFi signals are decent but not great. 5 GHz band signals are just avg. Reception is not as expected. Multi layering is as good as any ordinary router. Don‚Äôt go by the fancy content in the brand‚Äôs product description on AZ. If you want a regular dual-band router, then this is in the first line of available products along with others.",3
"Range isn't as good as advertised atleast for 2.4 GHz. Had the same range of my old Netgear N300 router( disappointed).
Added advantage is the number of devices allowed without the drop in bandwidth. Connected 3 phones 3 tablets and a laptop, ran them simultaneously, streaming found no issues when close to the router.
5GHz is only useful when you are close by which is expected.
Works good, looks big but light weight (little close to being flimsy).
No connection drops (had this issue with my old router), didn't test for connection exceeding 100Mbps.",3
"First one replaced due to ethernet ports not working, second one on reboot after 4th day never come up again...no power no light....a very poor device. Will never suggest anyone to buy it.",1
This router is a big fail to my upgrading plans. My wifi use to be much smoother and consistent over my previous roter of tp link with half the price. Signal keeps on disconnecting and take a long time to connect on 5ghz network. I am not sure if it's DHCP server problem or this router that ip address are assigned with a long delay.,2
This is by far the worst router I have ever purchased. I have no clue why it is so highly rated on Amazon. I bought a far cheaper Tenda router on AliExpress and that worked much better than this router. I do not know why this router even exists. Half the time there's signal problem. Other half there's problem connecting to it.,1
"I am writing this review after using this product for 3 months now. This router stopped working all of a sudden, and customer service is very poor.",1
"Writing a review after 4 months of usage.

The wifi is easy to setup and use. There are two channels 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz.

I'm using a 100Mbps internet at home and I get the full speed (literally 100Mbps) on 5Ghz channel.
However the maximum speed that I'd get on 2.4Ghz is hardly 40Mbps.

The smart switch (that automatically switches between these two channels) is also not giving speeds more than 70Mbps.

I called the customer care to address the issue on the speed and the interaction was full of surprises.

First thing, the technical representative is not so technical. I had to explain him the difference between MB and Mb.

Second, he said that it's expected to have a data loss of up to 50% on this router. I don't even know why one should go for such a pathetic router (after I informed him saying that no solution he provided had worked).

Third, he's not completely aware of the router specifications. I was surprised to hear that their company doesn't claim the support of 867Mbps on 5Ghz channel (which when later verified was proved to be false. I could download the spec from their website which clearly mentions it)

Fourth, being not so satisfied with the interaction, I wrote am email to the tech support team to look into the matter, but it's been more than 3 weeks with 2 reminders, but no one has responded so far.

So, after sale service is pathetic. Please don't go for this. We have better ones in the market",1
"Please don't buy this product as there are lot of bugs in software and there no proper support from TPlink Tech support after selling product. I'm facing issue while doing any Audio and Video calls through this Wifi router (Skype, Teams, Zoom, Whats app and Webex). Even my free Airtel router is more capable then this costly router.",1
"Edit/ STOPPED WORKING AFTER 7 MONTHS SERVICE CENTER WONT PICK THE CALL OR RESPOND TO EMAIL!
The wifi signal range is definitely not good and it's totally not worth the money for the range! I bought this thinking to extend the range of signal from my existing belkin router but this is worst then my existing router i now use my old router in the other corner of the home because this Tp link archer signal won't reach past 3 small rooms in open space with 3 antenna and 2 bandwidth! My belkin did better! I wouldn't suggest this to anyone pls go for other models or brands",1
"I m writing this review after 6 months. The product is getting switched of automatically. Called customer care and they asked to visit service center, as its still in waranty period. Now its more than 3 weeks , still waiting for replacement of my device. No response yet, every day i am calling now to know the status.",1
"Very low wifi strength, does not even cover a 2BHK properly. My recommendation would be go for Netgear or D-Link. They have far better quality in terms of customer service and signal strength compared to tp link.",1
"This is the worst WiFi router you can ever waste your money on.. I had bought this WiFi router a month back and within a month the router started giving problems..
The internet connection just drops in between, you can‚Äôt connect to the WiFi network as it keeps on asking password even if you saved the WiFi network in phone. The router just loses connection in between and unless you reboot the router the internet connection doesn‚Äôt really start.!
So I went back to my ISP to check if there is a problem on his end but after doing research I came to know this router has problems.. I am not the first person to complain on this but before buying you can visit the TP-link community forum a lot of people have posted the same problem.. Tp-link doesn‚Äôt even provide a solution to this by upgrading the firmware.
Waste of money.! There are other routers in the market which can perform seamlessly without this issues.
The WiFi strength is very good and it‚Äôs easy to install to., but v2 of these routers has a firmware problem which has yet not been solved by tp-link",1
"The WAN port was defective. The ethernet cable was not recognised by the router when I inserted it.

There was nothing wrong with the cable or the ISP as the internet is running fine when inserted directly into a laptop or another router.

Have initiated a return. Amazon will provide a replacement piece and take away the defective one. Good service by Amazon, but the product performance was a disappointment.",1
Bought this router on 30th April. They delivered withing a day. Installed the router in the same day. It was working fine till exactly after one of return window. The WAN port started malfunctioning and then it stopped working all together. Now I do not have the option to return and it is useless for me now. I bought it for 2499 which went down the drain. Highly disappointing experience.,2
"I have this router for a while now. I bought it to cover my wifi requirements in my duplex house.
Installed in my study room first floor, the signal strength was never good enough to provide uninterrupted internet to my TV ands security system (though the router is placed a floor above with ample of open space) so had to pair with another router to cover ground floor.
Signal strength is decent in primary room (study room) but half when comes to bed room, next room on same floor.
Also you might have to reboote it once I a while to nudge it!
Summary- Not a good product, does not cover what it claims. At best OK for a small flat with two rooms.",1
"Unfortunately, the ISP technician was available to install this router after the 10 day return window had closed. Switched on to discover it switched off immediately. This happened repeatedly. TP Link customer care confirmed it was a software error on a brand new router. That says a lot about product testing at TPLink!!",1
"Connection is not consistent. It's 1186 mbps, instead of advertised 1200 mbps. 2.4 GHZ doesn't go beyond 65mbps instead of promised 300 mbps.

It has high ping issue. Your calls keep getting disconnected. I got the replacement after a good amount of discussions with their service department. Unfortunately the replaced product also has the same high ping issue.

Customer care email is unsupportive. Customer care phone number doesn't get connected quickly and they are rigid to solve the problem. Instead of solving my problem, they were questioning me why did I buy this model.

Buy this only if you have a lot of time to do Time Pass and disturb your mental peace.",1
"I bought Archer C1200 to replace MI 3c router (which inspite of providing very good coverage across a 2500 Sq. ft. house, didn't let me leverage the complete connection speed of 150 Mbps).
The router in question does provide both 2.4 and 5 Ghz connectivity, as expected the range of 5 GHz. isn't much, but what really disappoints me is the range of 2.4 GHz, it is poorer than what Mi 3C provides.
Mi's signal inspite of being around -60 to -70 dBM does provide a speed of at-least 10 Mbps out of the incoming 100 Mbps( at a distance of 15 ft, not in straight like and behind walls), but very surprisingly TP Link C1200's speed drops to < 2 Mbps or the connection is lost.

For this reason i had to return it. For large homes(2500 Sq. ft. + ) this wouldn't be a good choice, even to be used as a repeater .",2
"Replaced my old 8 yr old TPlink with this model. Service provider had mentioned that since it‚Äôs old router I must buy new one.
For 200mbps wired connection old one used to give me 50Mbps speed and this C6 router is no different
Waste of money",2
"Hi,

Pros:
1. Installation is easy and happened within a minute.
2. Router looks are good.
3. The antennas are huge.
4. The processing power is great.
5. With 3 bands you can distribute your load easily and also give priority accordingly.

Cons:
1. No LED's on the side showing status. If you have kept the router at a height of 5 feet you wont be able to see any indications etc.
2. In spite of the huge antennas (6) the range is very low. It does not even cover my 1100 sq. ft flat.
The range is same as my 10 year old router.
Cannot penetrate multiple walls (not even 2).
3. Did not find any settings to boost the signal.
4. Too costly.

Overall not happy after spending 20K. Expected much better performance than I am getting.

TPLink please help to fix it or I may have to return the router and buy a cheap one which will perform the same.",3
"Well bought this top of the model Tp Link product just 6 months back.
However, after working fine for only 3 months this router started giving
problem.Currently in process to replace the same with Tp Link department.
I am disheartened to spend so much money on this product. I do hope
the Tp Link Department will solve my issue asap.
Lt Col S.K.Singh",1
"Works just ok. Nothing special. Signal strength is almost same as my old 900 bucks TP-Link router.
The signal strength fluctuates a lot.

I just bought it for the wireless ac, gigabit ethernet & USB share feature in order to improve my local network capabilities. I wanted to use it for flawless playback over plex from my desktop PC to chromecast, which works fine.

Main problem is it just reboots randomly sometimes which is very troublesome while playing any online multiplayer game. Also the reboot time is horrible. It just takes too long to boot up.",3
Basic function WDS bridging option is not available. Also got the hardware version is 2. But latest product version is 3.,1
"Pathetic service... 2 years and the router stopped working. Sent a mail and called up call centre but no response. They just don't have anything called customer service. Please avoid TP-Link. I would rather go back to netgear or D-Link.

The power booting went off and despite multiple mails to customer service and calls.. there is no response.

My old D-Link after 4 years still works!",3
"I got this router (TP LINK Archer C6) after carefully filtering among other routers since it was offering full gigabit ports i.e it supports internet speed upto 1 GBPS on all ports. I had ACT Fibernet 100 MBPS plan for which I was getting ~ 94 MBPS from the new TP LINK Archer C6 router (same speed as I was already getting from my old Mi Router 3C) and I was fine with it but luckily ACT Fibernet upgraded my plan to 150 MBPS one day after I got Archer C6 router, but the problem was I still wasn't getting speeds more than ~94 MBPS both via ethernet cable and 5 Ghz Wi-Fi. I didn't suspect the router as it said it was ""gigabit"" and directly enquired with ACT Customer Care. They told me to directly plug the ethernet cable provided by ACT to my desktop (which supports gigabit ethernet port) and to my surprise I was getting speeds ~300 MBPS from ACT. ACT even sent a technician who had ""Archer C5 test router"" with him which provided me > 150 MBPS speeds from router via ethernet cable and ~150 MBPS on 5 Ghz Wi-Fi. Then I got to know the culprit: TP LINK Archer C6 ""Gigabit"" router. The router was LIMITING my internet speed to 100 MBPS for some reason and I tried everything which was possibly available on google like turning QOS ""ON"" and turning ""ON"" and ""OFF"" NAT Boost but still could get speeds more than ~94 MBPS. Finally, I even called TP LINK India support and got to know they didn't know anything and just wasted 30 mins talking to them on phone. In the end, I returned the router and got a replacement router which was even worse than what I had received before. The new replacement router was LIMITING my internet speed to 10 MBPS which is way worse. Finally returned it again and got my refund. This was an horrible experience to me.",1
"it's smart connect mode is super terrible and waste!

even I was standing very close to the router, still it was giving a vry low speed of 2.4GHz but later I turned off the smart mode and had to manually switch to 5GHz to get max speed, which means by default it keeps ur device in 2.4ghz only, in smart conect mode.

though it has 4ext and 1 int ant + Mu-Mimo still giving the same network strength as my old c6 dual-band router with 3 ext ant only & which does not has mu-mimo also.

conclusion: inspite of having 5 ant. its 5Ghz band can not reach properly to my bedroom, which is not far but hardly 6 feets from the router, which kept in my flat's passage area, which is also the center of our flat.

am very disappointed with all these gimmick with TP link plays with us.",2
"Installation was easy as it is for any other router. Some technical specifications, but that's your wifi guy can help with.
2.4Ghz max bandwidth capping at 72Mbps against the bragged 300Mbps; 5 GHz at 433Mbps instead of 867Mbps. Since 5Ghz signal get week with distance, in most places in the house you will connect ti 2.4Ghz and won't get more than 30-40Mbps, given a max cap of 72Mbps transfer rate.

At times 2.4Ghz band stops appearing in the wifi list. That makes it difficult for older devices that only supported 2.4Ghz band. Sonfar, I have been able to manage it by changing channel and channel width in Router settings, but it's very inconvenient.
Distance wise, it is okay. I see other wifi signals from different floors, but this one goes down in corners/ wall crossings/ balconies (about 20-30 ft).

Tech support is really really poor 1. The junior teh support (that you will connect to when u call on tech support number) aren't much helpful - can only guide you through basic stuff. Their L1 team (escalation team) is either not willing or is unable to help, so they don't respond or trybti understand the issue. After followups, you will get the repeated the same stuff (really bad experience with them).

Summary - I got the first one reppaced, but the replaced router also have these issues. I suggest to do your reaearch and while comparing this one, consider it as a basic router with average distance coverage and the actual transfer rate capping...you may find many cheaper options that could give same results or may be go for even higher specifications.",2
"I bought this to upgrade from the old Tenda F3 router but instead of an upgrade this was a downgrade in terms of everything.

Connection is unstable, disconnects for no reason.

Speed drops from 100 MBPS to 1 MBPS after some usage.

Need to restart to fix the issue.

Range is also not as good as Rs. 1000 Tenda router.

Also, this router doesn't have a repeater mode so you can't even use it as a repeater with a primary router.

Overall I will not recommend anyone to buy this - maybe my unit is faulty and it is very hard to get it changed if you don't live in a metro.

Buy from a local shop and don't go with TP-Link.",1
I have purchased as my current Archer C750 was not having more than 90Mnps. The speed is erratic and not even reaching my earlier router. I have seen a couple of days of good performance Now it is very bad. I am not able to return this as the window for returning is closed. Total waste of money,2
"Edit after struggling to deal with the replacement process: after 2 calls to the Amazon Service Centre, I was directed to the TP link customer service/troubleshooting number. Was put on hold for 15 minutes past which I could connect with a technical guy. Nothing the technician suggested worked. The internet light remained off. Now I have to either personally visit the service centre or courier it on my own dime before being told what device I will be offered in return. I'm told that there's no refund at all; only a replacement will be offered. TP Link's rules, apparently. Which will take however long it takes. In the meanwhile, there's no way to connect to the internet without using our mobile data.

As understanding I can be about the scenario due to the pandemic, the servicing process for getting the device repaired is atrocious. The device itself should have been made better.

_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_

Bought it in December 2019, and it's stopped in August 2020. Started showing connectivity issues in July before stopping altogether. Have to check the return/replacement process now. Bought it on the recommendation of the other reviews, but my experience isn't good at all. This hassle is especially unnecessary during a pandemic.",1
"While the 5 Ghz frequency works quite well, the 2nd frequency of 2.4 Ghz frequency did not work well for our 4K TV & devices in other rooms on account of the walls . The company helped us with another product as replacement thanks to Amazon but suggest that you don't pick this product unless you wish to work on the prime frequency",1
"The delivery was done late by 1 day, seeing the lockdown in Maharashtra. The product was good and easy to set up. I have a 100 mbps connection and it delivers around 20-30 mbps on 2.4ghz and 60-90 on 5ghz. I have a wired connection on my computer with a maximum supported spead of 100 mbps and it sometimes delivers it. It does has a smart connect feature in which it shares same SSID for both 2.4ghz and 5ghz. The feature connects your device to the fastest(in terms of speed) frequency. Does has guest network on bot 2.4 and 5 ghz. The Tether app is there to control and setup your router. The router does has accs point mode in which it can extend your existing network through ethernet cable connected to wan slot given. The router is good for a carpet area of about 1000 sq.ft. My house is about 1200 sq.ft. and the range of the router is not adequate. There are speed and wifi drops when it is turned on and conneceted to any device for about 5 hours. It is kept in one corner of my house and when I go to the about 10 m, it starts disconnecting. So, please buy according to your house area.",3
"Horrible connectivity, Though i have the plan of 100 mbps, with 2.4ghz i am getting 20 MBps if i am 5 feet away from router . If I am standing beside router, am getting around 60MBP S which clearly says the signal strength issue. For 5 ghz getting 100 mbps and again coverage is a big issue.. Not worth of the money. Now bought extender as well but still ot did not helo much",1
Useless item as it worked only for a few days - once the Amazon replace window is over on isn‚Äôt able to get item replaced by company. I think the call centre treat has been advised to cut calls that talk of replacement . No adequate tech support,1
"Hopeless, not worth for 2400Rs, instead get a tenda or Dlink router in lesser price. Range is poor can't penetrate floor wall one room below exactly signal drops drastically. Router features are good but primary feature is the range and signal consistency. Frequent signal drops and smart switch is a gimmick. This router is worth 1800Rs max.",1
"The product was faulty and had extremely painful experience getting it replaced. I had to travel from Mumbai to their warehouse some 40-60km away from Mumbai to get the replacement. The other option was to go to Grant Road where I would get the replacement only after 15-20 days as was told.
I am not sure about whether the replaced will work or not.",1
I‚Äôm writing this review for Archer C6 model. Installation was quick n easy. But not happy with the speed it provides on both the bands. My old single band tplink router used to give me 80-90 mbps speed but this one gives me max 48mbps of speed for same plan n ISP for 2.4g band. 5g band gives me around 77mbps for 100mbps line. Also my old single band router has better range than Archer C6.,3
"I purchased this product to use in repeater mode. But this requires a wired connection to the root router. So, this product is not that great if you want to extend your WiFi range without running ethernet cables.",1
"WiFi signal coverage is less. Weak signal if u have couple of walls between. Dual band works as expected. Have not yet tested the USB. I got a USB 2.0 which is disappointing. was expecting USB 3.0 though it is not my primary purpose. Overall, satisfied. Will not say great. Little overpriced for the features provided.",3
"After 3 months of use, it stopped working due to technical fault. After several calls to toll free number,It is not being attended. Many emails sent, but no response so far.I am feeling helpless. I would not recommend anyones to buy to-link product as the product is not sturdy and warranty is immaterial due to worst after sale service.",2
"Even with 4 antennas, signal strength is not that great as expected. Within 3 or 4 meters range, signal gets dropped by one bar Starts slowly, apart from that it takes around 1 to 2 minutes to start after power lost or reboot
Network range is very much disappointing and looking for Return.
Built quality is good, Looks wise Good",3
"Review after using it for 20 days.
It gets often disconnected from actual network and breaks internet very often. Very worst experience. I tried both in router and access point mode. Having connecting lan and wireles together.",2
"I have an exisiting TPLINK W8968 router and TPLINK AC750 range extender.

CONS: The product received is defective due to the following reasons:-
1) The router page does not open (get detected) when connected with cable connection during the installation. Thus internet cannot be accessed.
2) All the LED lights glow GREEN and CONTINUOUSLY even when LAN and WLAN cables are removed. So this indicates a serious fault.
3) The hard reset button also at back of the router is not working even after multiple attempts to press for 10/20/60+ seconds.

Although the router received is defective some pros are specified as under.
PROS: The router supplied is actually a more superior ARCHER C6 version 3.0 (see photo) wheas the Amazon description pertains to the older version 2.0 of ARCHER C6. The ARCHER C6 version 3.0 is much sleeker in appearance than the older version 2.0. So this was a good point.

A return and replacement of the same TPLINK ARCHER C6 version 3.0 is requested by me from Amazon and I hope the same is respected. I will update this review after I receive the same.",1
"Pros:
Compact and light
Hangable on wall

Cons:
Atleast I didn't recieve the signal in ground floor after placing this on 1st floor in 1200 sqft site. So signal strenth is weak.

P.S. Amazon need to update the image to match new version C6 Archer",3
"TP-Link Archer C6 AC1200 Wireless MU-MIMO Gigabit Router --- even with 4 antennas, the signal coverage is not good. i had netgear 4 years old and the coverage provided by netgear and this TP link are same. With 5G GHZ the coverage is very poor. from my 1 floor where i kept the router, the signal disconnection is more for ground floor. with 2.4 GHZ also the coverage is poor. when the doors are closed in other room in the 1 floor where router is placed signal degrades from 99 Mbps to 30 Mbps.

Also parental controls were not good like netgear. netgear has a very good UI and customizable control. it can block based on the content and not just based on the URL/Domain name.

so i dont recommend this router",2
Finally I am able to get my USB Drive on the network. and the speed is awesome too. Lower rating only because the SUB port supports only a single drive. Cannot connect through a hub which I would have expected a basic behavior. Not even an externally powered hub seems to be acceptable.,3
"Best Budget 5GHz router, but 5GHz struggles to penetrate the concrete wall.

Personally I did not like power Adapter build quality.

The router has scratches at back below the ports, I could live with it but such things are not expected.

I disliked the black colour shade on the router personally.

Sometimes wifi symbols don't lit up when I switch on the router, feels buggy - This was an initial issue, after 2-3 days issue was not observed again.

UI is damn slow, I would love if I see the snappier user interface.",1
"I bought this in March 2019, but started using it or more to say unwrapped just 2 weeks back. The initial setup was good quite easy. Range in 2.4 ghtz is ok not great but the speed it sends in 2.4 is quite less. I mean almost 30 to 40 Mbps drop from the original 100 mbps it receives. In 5 Ghtz I could receive the speed as is but the range is very poor understandably.
Worst problem is heating up. The router heats up very fast and the input port (internet input port) stopped working 2 days before. So the life time is just around 10 days. Now the router is not working at all. I've to reach out to the customer support as it's weekend there is no support. Will post an update once I could reach out to them.",2
"I had a dlink dir 816 with three antennas before this router, Seriously i think the range of these two compared was same despite the tplink one having 5 antennas with more range as claimed . Don't go for the positive reviews of people who have no idea what they are talking about. The range of this router is not worth it . And yeah it also freezes as does any other router in this price point .",1
"On first installation, all devices connected to the internet and everything was fine. But, after shutting down the router overnight and restarting it in the morning, only some devices had internet connection. Though all the devices could connect to the router, there was no internet connectivity on some devices. Did a search on the net, and found on the TP-Link community that many people have this issue. Have asked for a replacement of this router. If issue persists with the replacement, then there should be issues with the hardware or its firmware.",1
" Internet connection issue all the time, please its been 2 days my router is showing orange light, my internet is working with LAN connection but its not working with router, router cannot reset cannot fresh setup, please help",1
"I don't prefer this to anyone. I bought this router as suggested by my internet provider. For first two weeks the signal strength was good. After that the signal was very much week. My internet speed is supposed to be 250 MBPS. I am getting around 30 MBPS only. I contacted the support team several times. I am really dissapointed with the support team. First of all it is difficult to reach them (will take hell lot of time to connect). They will only give online support. In between call get disconnected multiple times. They don't have even courtesy to call us back. If I connect with them again I need to explain from scratch again. If we need to replace the product we need to go to their location only. With all these difficulties, I don't recommend this product to anyone.",1
My Dlink router which purchased for Rs.1500/- is giving the same signal strength that of TP Link Archer. Wasted My money(7500) thing it would boost the Wi-Fi signal strength. tried placing the router in different places and the angular placement of the areals. nothing works. a waste of time and money...,1
"Don't buy this product, it stopped working after 6 months, no help from the customer care, called them up with 20 mins minimum wait time only for them to cut the phone because they have network issue. No senior person is responsible for any problems I am facing, I asked for a replacement, they said they have forwarded the request to the team and mail will be received, but no mail has come, been waiting for a month for them to help me. been calling them everyday for the past month everyday with no solution. As for the device the range is very less even on the maximum range setting, was using this as an extender.",1
"After using for almost 6 months I can say, My 10 year old D-Link which I got for 800rs gives better range and no connectivity drops. This tplink router gave me lan as well as WiFi issues. And its range is beyond pathetic.... Even in 2.4ghz mode... Don't waste your money.",1
"Everything is good but not reliable product. It stops working after 10 days.
I am in Delhi and only one service center in Nehru Place.
There is no support at all.
Please think before buying specially if you are in interior part of india.
I recommend not to buy.",1
"Being dual band and costly , the range of the device is less than my old onu router. Range is very bad and i didnt expected. Model image is confusion. I got version 3 model mesh router. Image is version 2 router. I think version 2 range is better than version 3 as per some youtube review. Rest people are smart.",2
Router keeps randomly losing internet connectivity almost once a day and comes back after about 10 minutes. It is really annoying. Wifi range is also just average. All routers in this price range are just average. I would suggest you to spend a little more and get a archer c7 or higher one.,2
"The product stopped working after couple of weeks. The power light keeps blinking. While the router performance is good, the unreliability is a big problem. Saw many people facing this issue on online support forums. Not recommended. On top of that the tp link support is the worst, I have been trying to reach them but it is too difficult. It is like they are deliberately trying to avoid you. Call any time and you have to wait a long time. Feel like my money is wasted.",1
"First the WAN port stopped working 3 months in.
Then 8 months in, the LAN ports stopped working.

This one sold by LowBuy might not be genuine, since I also bought two of these earlier from the StyleReferee and they work perfectly a year in.",1
"The package looked normal. However, when turned on the default SSID was not visible. After, investigating with wifi analyzer, found that SSID name was 'Found_Virus'. Is it a joke?. I had to reset to get back the printed ssid and then installed with tether app. I am not happy with the experience. I hope the performance will be OK as it claims.",1
"Wifi signal is weak even in 2.5G bandwidth and not even an inch in 5G.
Even you change room signal becomes weak in 2.5G
Forget about signal if you change the floor.
I do also have Mi Router. Frankly speaking Mi Router costs me 700 and best in terms of signal coverage and all.",2
"Writing this review after use of 4 months. First I received different router with C6 box packing. After complaining, I got the replacement with correct device.
This router comes with 4 antenna which exactly works similar as that of single antenna tp-link router. I have duplex house, and network doesn't connect when I'm seating just on the below floor. It doesn't even connect properly when I'm on the same floor with one room away from router. I initially had single antenna tp-link router (TL-WR72ON) and I really don't see any difference in both routers. My network speed is 50mbps which works fine when I'm seating on same floor where my router is kept. I really regret my choice of selecting this router.",1
Such a pathetic router i have ever purchase when start it takes 2 to 5 minutes to fully start light blinking start like big heavy machine takes too much time it‚Äôs just a router nota a train engine üëéüëéüëéüëéüëédon‚Äôt purchase it at all seriously,1
"Review after using it for few days, 2.4ghz band speed will be at least 40 to 50 percent less, and it will disconnect continuously, 5ghz band works fine. Even tp link support does not know how to fix it, seems like very bad firmware, downgrading or upgrading does not fix it.. Pay little more and buy other products. I have tried all troubleshooting possible from encryption to channel changes.. Same issues.. PS all devices connected at 2.4 ghz will disconnect at the same time.",1
"The wifi is not at all durable the signal keeps on tripping, it has also been giving speed issues. I had just bought it a few months ago and now it has stopped giving download speed and now it has stopped working. The product is not at all up to the mark and overpriced. According to my personal experience with it. fROM PICTURE ALSO YOU ALL CAN SEE THAT THE ROUTER IS COMPLETELY IN A FRESH STATE AND HAS NOT BEEN DAMAGED FROM ANYWHERE",1
"I had the entry level router, the typical white WRN840 before purchasing this, I specifically went for this router assuming that this will simply be marginally better in WIFI range than the previous one. And oh was I so wrong, this thing covers the same, if not shorter range than the most simple router out there, and all the functions MIMO MOMO are just there for the sake of justifying the price point.Also, for a router that's supposed to be on 24/7, this thing gets hot at the bottom,A huge Red flag......well, this is the review,its upto you to decide :)",2
Router is not providing stable connection. It is frequently disconnecting also signal strength is not good. Avoid the product. Also due to some issues installation and configuration was not done in a return window so unable to return the item.,1
"USB port is for storage devices or 3G/4G Dongles, but not for USB Tethering. Wifi signal is very weak, doesn't cover a full room. Setup is also very complex. Don't call a thing portable on the basis of its size only. It should be easy enough like plug and play to be called 'real portable'.",1
Worked wonders on installation but within 15 days signal and range started dropping. Tried to call their Kolkata office. After many attempts someone picked up the phone. Advised me to talk to the 1800 tech support who was least helpful. Now I have to cart it to their local office and try and get it fixed.,1
"The signal range is pretty bad especially when you're in another room separated by a wall or two you almost get no signal at all. Although if you stay within the same room which is small to medium in size, everything works just fine. Extremely easy to setup and use right away. Very user friendly.",1
"After lots of research I purchased this router, also it mentions a long and better coverage fails which failed to cover 2bhk flat. I borrowed same router from one of my friend I check its work fine. Due to technical it manufacturing defect I had asked Amazon for a replacement.
I would request to check and buy.
Thanks.",3
I'm using tp-link N450 for a while now. Then I bought this router to use it as wireless extender but it does not support wireless bridging even with other TP-Link routers. worst product by tp-link ever. Router with Hardware Version 1.1 do have WDS support but I don't understand why tp-link removed wireless bridging Hardware Version 2 routers. Don't buy this if you want to connect it with other wireless router or even jio-fi.,1
"I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone. The router continually turns on and off itself and often loses connectivity making using it a very harrowing experience. It is impossible to get a stable connection for extended use be it for video calls, gaming or shopping. I tried updating the firmware, resetting it multiple times but there is no improvement. TP - link forums also show that I'm not the only one facing such issues.",2
"User interface is good, but the product uses SMB 1.0 which sucks. THere is little to bad security since there is not updates for firmware vulnerabilities nor any updates for softwares. The router randomly reboots on continous usage which is really bad. My old Tenda and Cisco 900 router is much more stable than this.",2
Guys its been only 2 weeks I bought this router and it has already started showing problems now. Wifi keeps disconnecting on channel 2.4. I called tp tech support multiple times and they couldn't resolve it. They promised the replacement and now they have gone unresponsive. Pathetic customer support and service. Please think through before you buy this router.,2
The Router Wan Port Does Not Work After 3 months Use. I Cant Any Help With Tp Link Service And Support I Want To Claim Warranty But no Way To Do It. Their Customer Support Useless no any one Picked Call And Did not Get Any Online Solution. Don't Buy Tp Link Any Product.,1
"This is not an excellent router, it comes under good router category, It takes approx 20secs to start and connect to internet and the coverage area is pretty bad, despite of having 2 and 5ghz bands. I live in a 1bhk room and Router i have is in my bedroom and the range cant get to Hallroom. I would suggest you to go with tenda. You will be able to easily get good range and it also comes with the gigabit port and every other feature this router comes with. So make a wise choice i would say go with tenda's ac10.",3
"When in close range I can get full internet speedas per my broadband plan. However, the wifi range is not as impressive as advertised. I live in a 2bhk apartment and still observe a big drop in internet speed when moved to other room from where the modem is located (sometimes more the 50%).
So if you are looking for good range, should look for alternate options as well.",3
"Worst customer service. Since more than a week my router is not working and I am constantly following up with TP link call center. Still my issue has not been resolved. I may lose my job because I'm working out of home and since last 7 days I have not been able to work due to the pathetic customer service provided by To link.
I hope at least now someone will take up my complain seriously.",1
"The box seal was alread been opened the box was for the new unit but i actual router was the old C6 Archer.
Plug in and try to setup, the router was alread setup for The Sirsa Heritage as the Wifi SSID and couldn't login to router page. Had to do a hard reset. This proves that the unit was worng and old.",1
"I have ordered many TP-Link routers but this is the worst product of all. I don‚Äôt know if it is manufacturer‚Äôs or seller‚Äôs fault but this product is not switching on. I don‚Äôt recommend this product particularly from this seller. I have ordered this for my brother for a different address. We went there and opened the package after 20 days of delivery. We even lost the return item option. If seller is reading this, let me know if you can replace the product. Otherwise, stop selling crap.",1
"The router works well and is a good purchase at its price.
The only issue was that it was already used and had a different SSID name. The bugger that had used it, set some passed and left it. He had not reset it.
Since I had an urgency and did not want to go through the exchange process I 'cleared' it myself.
I had to hard reset it and then it's worked all right.
So, the product is good, seller is not reliable. I got a used product, so choose the seller wisely.",2
"I have purchased this router after checking some comparisons in youtube, but still its range is not good even my old router with single antenna work better. And it also continues not working it requires daily restart. My old router sometimes need restart. Not good experience with this product.",3
" I am not sure if this is original product or duplicate. Is this A6 or C6. Photo in amazon app show different product them what is delivered.
Update right photo or deliver product same as shown in amazon app.",3
I got this in September and now wan port does not work. In one month router has become useless. Now I got to deal with tplink to get a fix or replacement because Amazon return period has ended. Not happy at all.,2
"This product is useless, doesn't even have SIM card slot for creating network.

On top of that, Amazon doesn't even take the product in return. Only exchange is allowed. So once you buy it but can't use it, you have wasted your money",1
I purchased 2 of these to use one as a main router and other as wireless repeater . RANGE OF THE ROUTER IS GOOD Not anu extraordinary and neither low range . also the speed is satisfactory . But the issue i faced is making it as a wireless repeater . Thats another story that by some youtube videos you can do it but whats the point in all that of they can simply put an option in interface.,3
"Internet light turns orange (i.e. no wifi) for 30 seconds after every 30 minutes.
I have checked while using it via Airtel and Excitel. When the light turns orange for 30 seconds my meeting on team gets interrupted and its creating a nuisance.
Either the product was damaged or or there is some technical default.
I have used it for over a month now and I hope I get some way to replace this product since returning the product is not an option now.",1
Very weak wifi signal. Even tenda 300 single band router is giving better signal than this. I want to replace this and buy another one. Basis security settings are missing in this router. totally waste of money. better to go for any cheap router available.,1
writing this review on same day of getting product. Immediate observation is used router as SSID WAS BHUSHAN@YOGA_5G than default SSID. WIFI signal not as claimed. It needed extender to get signal on another floor and overall height difference is just 11-12 feet. It was easy to setup. However have to repeat installation for both bands. Not yet needed tech support so more once I use it for few months.,3
"Ethernet port to the desktop stopped working after 2 weeks. Tried Installing previous router and it was working fine but it was very hard to setup for the first time. It's interface was easy and I've been using routers for almost 8 years now . So , the set-up was easy for me but it won't just connect to the internet.
After many tries it finally connected and after 2 weeks it's now broken.
It's my first tp link product and I'm likely to never buy something from this company.",1
"I have heard TP-Link adapters are good, so I preferred to buy for home use. But installation process was very difficult, I contact customer care support, but it wasn't useful as expected, and technician support not available anywhere. Only tp link customer service available. So I had no option returned the product.",2
"The router didnt work with excitel fiber PPPOe connection type..after attempting to connect it several times and failing, I decided to return. The router being sold is a US version, it seems this version has problems with pppoe.",1
Not a good router. Dont go with comments. It doesnt work fine as repeater. WDS function is not good. It does not automatically connect with master router after master router is rebooted. Need to connect manually each time. Gateway is not responsive most of the times. Overall the product is too cheap.. Has 4 antennas and 1 inbuilt antenna but no any benefit of wifi coverage. I thought My old 5ghz 1200mbps huawei router signal strength is weak hence I bough this but no benefit.,3
"I am posting this review after 10 months of usage. Speed and wifi signal strength all are up to the mark. However, the one of the lan port stopped working after 6 months, within next 4 months another lan port stopped working. Therefore giving low rating.",2
"I bought this product from Amazon in April 2019 and in less than a year it has stopped working on it's own!! I always used it with the TP link adapter that was provided with the router and now it's just not turning on!!

Total waste of Rs ~2,800

I used it for my home and there are only 4 members in my family (including me). Gadgets that were connceted to this router were 4 cell phones, 3 laptops, 1 Smart TV and PS4.

My old small capacity Netgear router is still working which I boght for Rs ~900. When it comes to durability and reliability I would go with Netgear over TP Link",1
"The router was perfect for a couple of months. Bought this early December 2019. Off late it's been dropping speeds on 5G wifi. I have a 200 mbps ACT plan and it's dropping atleast 60-70 mbps even when I'm standing right next to the router. Out of the three antennas that came along with the router the middle one has always been a little loose than the other two as well.

Overall, not really worth the money!",2
"Have been using this for the past year and since then I have been facing issues with its 2.4GHz band, it drops connection every few hours whereas the 5GHz band works flawlessly.
It is a recognized issue from TP-Link and you can search it on google as well. Many users are facing the same issue.",1
"I have used the router for 2 months and now the Router only provides 4 to 5 Mbps on wifi.

It worked fine intially and now I can see that the Router cannot be faster than the speed of 4Mbps.

My advice is do not buy as the reliability is very low",2
"Only buy this router if you need to upgrade to 1GB lan port.
I previous own 11 year old single antenna intex router and range of Archer C6 is just 5% better as compared to old intex one. That was not i was expecting.",1
"The router was easy to connect and install. But for the cost i did not see any improvement in wifi signal. My 2BHK flat (800) carper is not fully covered, with weak to no-signal in corner rooms.

So very disappointed with the product.",3
Not sure if this is a genuine product or not,1
"Writing this after almost 3 months of purchase, if u want to buy router for good area coverage {2,3BHK flat} ...Don't buy.
My brother has router which has only 2 antenna n cost much lower than this , gives better range . If u need high performance go for higher segment router, but if need something medium range don't waste money on this. This one just performs as good as 1 k router.",1
"I got a used router or the old one... I have added the pics of the packing. Box was stoned and the inside cover was bamaged.
I still installed it as it an need of an hour.
Regarding Router- its working as expected and easy to install. Speed I good can wath videos in firestick with out buffering.",3
"Wifi signal strength is not good. I'm living in a small 2bhk with around 1100 sft. But the router couldn't provide adequate signal from hall to bedroom. I have an other router which is huawei doing a much better job than this.
The dual band provides the speed on 5g. But, signal is pathetic and there are signal drops every now and then. Without signal the dual band is worthless. 5g coverage is really horrible. Can get signal to the next room.
I thought it was a problem with one piece, got it replaced and the replacement also had the same issue.
2.4G speed is useless. 10 mbps on a 100 mbps line.
So was not able to use 5g or the 2.4g and had to send back the second router as well.",1
"Product is good, but Tp-Link service is very bad. I got support after @15 days after following-up customer service several times. Amazon also help to get support.

If you think for Wall Mounted you face Connectivity problem as per Tp-Link, but the facility is available.",3
"Received a defective product. Tried all sorts of help available on online support. Was unable to reach customer support due to never ending waiting times. Finally had to dedicate an entire Saturday evening troubleshooting along with TP link customer support only to find that product is faulty. Apparently the WAN port is not functioning. Since it is beyond 10 days from order delivery, I am asked to either physically go to service center or bear the delivery charges. Extremely dissapointed with this kind of service.",1
"My Wifi Calling was very much unstable. Keeps switching between VoLTE & VoWiFi frequently. Had to return it.

My tplink C60 is much better in this matter.",3
Brought the router in Jan 2021. Worked well for some time. But the device is stopped working completedly within three months. Hoping the customer service will give me a replecement. After starting the device blinks and switches off after 30 secs blinking.............,1
"DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK DEVICE!! VERY VERY VERY POOR RANGE!!
If you are looking for a good router for a decent home which needs better range in terms of dual band, I suggest to avoid this. Rest of the things are good but range is very much disappointing as my previous Netgear N150 is far beyond much better than this in terms of range.
Also after started using this for more than 1 month, I feel this is not at all worth the cost.
Go for other brands if you looking for good range. I seriously wanted to return this product and buy another one if Amazon could allow.",1
"Returned this item since it does not support Gigabit speed on LAN when used as a repeater.
Gigabit speed is only possible when used as a router.
Hopefully this is fixed with a new firmware update.",3
"The router does not switch devices from 2 GHz to 5 GHz automatically, even if one is within 1 feet of router.

On the other hand router switches devices from 5 Ghz to 2 GHz very effectively.

For 5 GHz the range of wifi signal is not good.

Easy to configure router.",3
"Parental controls not working at all. Followed manuals, tried all the possibilities, still no luck. I doubt whether the product is genuine or some duplicate? Network range is bad even when I compare with my age old N300 router of 2.4ghz. Called TP-Link support, they mentioned as to mail. Till now no reply.",1
If u plan to extend ur range n see 4 antennas then this is not for u. It has two frequencies n transmitting n one frequency is under 5gz which is for 1to 3 mbps line whose range is hardly adjoining room n other is regular signal whose range is two to three rooms and ur compound,2
"When connected to ethernet the speed got reduced drastically and often the wifi speed went down in a single day . when ethernet connected directly to my laptop i got 93 download speed but when connected through this router port the speed got reduced drastically to 50 mbps. first i thought it was network proble but after testing , the actual problem was with this router.",2
"Keeps disconnecting one connected on 5ghz network. If 3 devices are connected on 2.4ghz, the router hearts up. I purchased it for my work from home. Now I have to look for other options since the tech support took to long to respond. It is out of replacement date.
DO NOT PURCHASE",1
"This router works great if you only want to use the 5Ghz band. On switching on both bands, the connection becomes unstable, especially on the 2.4Ghz band. There are many negative reviews describing this issue.",2
"The overall performance is good. Good coverage, easy to set-up. But only problem I had was no wds bridging option. I wanted to use the new router as extender but when I tried to set up there was no option available. That is the only reason I returned it because I wanted a wds supported router.",3
In specifications it is mentioned as 1 gigabit wan and lan ports. But its is not supporting more than 100mbps on LAN ports. I'm the support only on wireless with 5 GHz. Event I'm not seeing more than 100mbps speed on 2.4 GHz.,3
"unfortunately i waited for 10 days to let it work properly , but its not. the signal is off and on slow to 0 and first , huge fluctuation resulting breaks in net all the time. I tried to contact customer care but holding the line for hours, no one there. I wish some one instantly come over check it and fix or change it . I have never seen any thing worst since 20 years , I am using net. company can find my address and fix it. need instant response.",1
"Had bought it for one simple reason. I wanted to control the time when my kids are online. And it just is not intuitive as the manufacturer claims. Am an IT professional and tend to think this should be easy, but I guess it is not.

The wifi signal is also not that great in its dual band mode as the description claims. My previous 900 Bucks ""Baton"" router had more coverage than this one. FYI, I have a house that is on 2 levels.... and the router is placed in the middle on top floor... I do not get full signal even in the bedroom next to it.

I will recommend... that all this Dual Band etc... is nothing but a sales gimmick on this model.",1
Wifi signal strength is great and it is easy to install but when I connect it to my asus laptop it does not give speed and connect to 2.4GHz band instead of 5GHz band even if I am in close proximity to router. One thing to notice is that when I directly use lan wire coming out of router port then laptop works just fine. I already checked all sort of changes to laptop and router but not reached to any solution so far. On other mobile devices it works smoothly and with good speed.,3
"Trust me guys, dont ever by this router model AC1200 MIMO. Doesnt have return policy. You cant connect zoom calls, henceforth always you will search for mobile hotspot. Tplink Customer care also cannot provide solution. Every 10 secs you will get request time out and general failure. I have archer c6 it was working fine, bt wan only support 100 mbps. I tried to increase internet speed and wasted my money",1
"The router has a poor wifi range. Even the 2.4 GHz signal range is very poor.
I am able to connect to wifi only if I am in the same room or adjacent room, where the router is placed.
When you are paying around Rs.2600 for router, you expect better range than this.",1
Wifi signal strength is not strong at all. Can't penetrate even a signal wooden door. 2GHz band has speed of <1Mbps on a 100Mbps plan at a distance of 1meter. 5GHz band gave a higher speed of about 90Mbps at 1meter distance. Returned the router.,3
This dual band router is not good 5ghz band does not work with multiple channels it has less bandwidth settings so it may not compatible with your broadband connection aldo tp link sells the global version in india so there might possibility that it has limite your channel accessibility. It's better to bu tenda ac1200.,1
"Please do not buy this router. I bought it in October of 2019. Firstly It took 5 minutes to turn on after load shedding. But now it takes 35 minutes to 1 hour to turn on. The router comes under a 3 year manufacturing warranty and after informing TP-LINK India, they didn't help. Speed is good but you will suffer a lot from this problem. No one will help you.",3
I bought a net gear router 10 years back for 1500 rs it still works fine .recently i purchased this router hoping that i will provide good range but after using it i came to know that this router is not worth it and provide the same signal strength as net gear router which in purchased 10 years back don't buy this router.i will request amazon to return half money.,1
"Router started disconnecting from internet frequently after 3 months. Since it was under warranty, I contacted TP Link and submitted my router for replacement. It has been more than 2 months and I have still not received any replacement. Pathetic customer care service.",1
"WiFi range is ""OK"" for the price... The speed is awesome! But it overheats and reboots atleast 2-3 times a day

Edit: changed to 2 star... Number of reboot increased ... Every 2-3 hrs it reboots now",2
"My internet provider says I‚Äôm not getting full speed because of this router, when they restore and setup this router it work with more than 100mpbs again but again in day come back to low bandwidth. I wonder if I needed to reset it daily !!",1
"Rcvd an open box... Different product.. Not expected from Amazon... Packaging dept should be a little bit educated..please track last billing customer using serial number of the product and blacklist him.. It avoid a lot of time and resources, and this type of things.",1
"Do Not buy ,this product has a lot of issues like frequent disconnect, speed drop in between, showing no internet in 5g mode but 2g works fine at the same time.

Updated the firmware but still issues not resolved, also support is not good.",1
"When multiple devices are connected, some devices intermittently can not connect to internet. This happens quite frequently. Wifi signal is not very strong though it comes with 3 antennas. I had a dlink router earlier which was a smaller device with 2 antennas but had better wifi signal. Signal strength in 5g is very poor even in the same room. Speed when connected to internet is quite good though. I was expecting a much better performance from connectivity perspective.",3
"Archer C6 purchased a month back.
There's been very frequent connection drop. Have tried many options including using only one band, changing channels and updating firmware has not helped solve the problem.

Wrote to tp link support for help 10 days ago and no response so far.

Now am forced to look for a different router.",2
"Received an second hand used product. The name of the logo was completely faded, product had scratches, the antenna was kinda dented...could not believe my eyes they could do something like this...please be carefull while placing the order or checking your order once received.",1
" Wifi is not working at all.!!!
No support from technical team. warranty is of no use.Tried emailing and contacting them but is of no use.Within 3 months of our purchase product has failed!!!
Disappointed.",1
"Worked for month and a half after which started giving me timeout issues.

Initially I thought the problem was with service provider but later on when I ran ping command on router I found it gives timeout every 30-45 seconds which disconnects my VPN, Skype calls etc.

I have for now switched back to my 10 year old netgear router with limited bandwidth.

Chinese poor quality product",1
"Few cons -
- Wifi speed is not going beyond 100 mbps even though lan speed says 200 mbps
- Smart bulbs and smart devices like alexa are getting disconnected at least once in a day. I have to restart the router to make these smart devices work again. It was working fine with TP Link TL-WR940N 450Mbps",2
" Bad product. Been having an issue right from day-1. Frequently disconnects from internet. The internet light shows green but there will be no internet connection. Today the router went totally off. When I restarted by doing a power off and on, it blinks for sometime and then totally shuts off. Video attached.",1
"The package was received today with out any sealing and in an open form. It looked like a refurbished piece. I am yet to test it. I did not expect this from Amazon. Since it was a no contact delivery, the coirier dropped off at security gate and left and by the time I reached the gate he had left.",2
I was little disappointed today cause I was expecting much better range from TP Link AC5400 router but the wi-fi range is same as like my other TP Link A6 router. You may try ASUS router which has got a 5 STAR rating because of the wi-fi range coverage.,3
"It doesn‚Äôt have Wpa3 security Protcol though it‚Äôs supposed to. The option of WPA2/WPA3 doesn‚Äôt appear, please clarify.",1
Please do not buy this router. This router has major issues. This router stop working after continue working of 3 to 4 hours. This this router is creating loops on the network. You have to restart this route after 3 to 4 hours every time.,1
"Worst product. I booked on 21 Dec 2020 and now I facing a problem for on/off
Troubleshooting:
* I Did hard reset and power cycled the router
* I Did on and off reset
* I Checked with different power sockets
* I Checked with different power adapter
* Still no light lit on the device. warranty of 3 year but no use they are saying that water went inside the device. How is possible I don't know.they are replacing it.",1
"On Amazon it says 2000 to 3000 sq ft range but it drops to zero after 15 ft and even I can't get range in the connecting room. The call center guys telling us that range of product is only 15 meters. I suggest don't buy it, even a cheap Indian product is 100 times better than this.",1
"Build quality is good. Speed is also fine. But the main purpose of the router is coverage area. It doesn't even have half the strength for just 10 Ft from the place where it was installed. Move 15 Ft plus one wall in the middle, the speed drops upto 90%. This was totally unexpected. I updated the firmware and tried other tricks also, but still the result is same. Usage within 10 FT is fine. Anything beyond is of no use.",1
"Constant fluctuating network. Will show connected but the internet not working, constantly needed to reconnect to the line for internet. But recently it has been less of approximately 1-2 times a day. Earlier it was much more. Signal strength fluctuates with devices with range. Samsung can be a no for far connections, asus, xiaomi, oppo, iphone, moto, seems fine. Xperia is till mid ranges. Similar with nokia.",3
"Not good.
2.4 GHz band has issue in connectivity. Sometimes it loses connectivity. After restarting, it gains connectivity. Just after using nearly two months I am facing this issue. Even after doing so many changes in the 2.4 GHz band setting, I am facing the issue till now.
Not recommending this product to anyone..",1
"Wifi range suits for 2 bhk less than 1200 sft area and not suits for 3 bhk, After using it for almost 2 months, I onserved that this router disconnects wifi very frequently where as I haven't faced this issue with my previous router, Not recommended for office work as it disconnects very frequently and u need to re-start ur applications every time.",2
"According to the price it's just normal not as hyped. Wifi signal is not so strong.
It's easy to install and the user interface is quite simple.
But not as tp link brandishing it to be.",2
"I bought this router mainly for its speed and signal strength. The speed is quiet decent but the signal strength is not so great. i placed this router on my 2nd floor and i hardly get 1or2 signal bar in 1st floor, so for me the signal is not so good. Now about the speed, which its nice and not so problematic.",2
"I bought this router for its good range as it's previous version was known for its connectivity range. Unfortunately, this one turned out to be very poor in terms of range. 5ghz was is not meant for long range but you can expect good network range at 2.4ghz. However, this router is even bad at it, 2.4ghz does not even cross 10m which for me to return this router. Extremely disappointed.",1
"1. Worked well as a Wired WiFi router for the CISCO modem for You BroadBand connections.
2. The Bedroom installation did not reach the leaving room - with a kitchen in between.",3
"Expected a lot from it but disappointed as it restarts once in every 2 hrs. Returned It.

Pros:
1. Easy installation
2. Good mobile app
3. Internet Speed is good in 2.4 ghz

Cons:
1. Restarts every couple of hrs.
2. Wifi Signal strength is less, my other 900 rs TPlink router gives the same signal strength.
3. Rebooting takes lot of time, my 900 rs router reboots with in seconds.
4. Bigger in size.",3
"Returns this router as it offers nothing great. 5 ghz range is poor and very limited ...you have to be at the router to use it, hence not useful...other cheaper 2.4 GHz routers outperform this one...",1
"I bought TP-Link Archer C6 around 6 months back. After a few days of use the router started having connection drops, even when I am sitting in the next room some times the signal is full and some times it goes to poor without even changing your position. Now if u try to reach their service center the phone is unreachable and when I visited the only service center address they have for North India on their website, it is closed.",2
"Was given a faulty piece. Appario retail sucks. By the time we realised that the router was not working as intended, the window for return was already closed. Huge loss due to this. Have had multiple experience with Appario. Please refrain from ordering this.",1
I bought this hoping it would cover my 2 bhk house!! Little did I know it would only cost me more but would not serve the purpose. I was using a single antenna router which gives me same signal strength as this one. Only in terms of speed it is good not for large spaces!!,3
Item taken to gift to someone. After opening the box found Charger was broken. Really it was very very disgusting. Now it can not be returned as we have open the box for inatallation now & its exceed the days over return policy. But it should have been checked before packing the material. It looks that someone has returned the box & its given to us. Unforfunatley we have opend it very late.,1
"Even with 4 antennas, signal strength is not that great as expected. Within 4 meters range, signal gets dropped by one bar. Starts slowly, it takes around 1 to 2 minutes to start after reboot as compared to D-Link which starts in 20 seconds. Built quality is good but bit overpriced. I purchased it for 2500 but don‚Äôt buy it if it‚Äôs above 2k.",3
Is returning the product possible? It does not serve our purpose (support the DSL connection) and is not useful for our home. Want to return it!,3
"Pathetic router... disconnects automatically. Have to manually restart 10 times a day, if you're a request user.
No customer service!
Don't go for this one. It's crap, gets disconnected on its own. Need to restart 5-6 times a day.
I have 100 mbps connection and yet I get on 25-30 mbps",1
Getting disconnected very frequently...Not getting connected to mobile....Getting Obtaining IP address and will never gets connected.....Very very very frequent disconnection....every time need to switch off and on to get it worked...It will last for few hours and there after same issue. Don't have option to replace this useless product.,1
"I ordered for the new Product but the product delivered was already used by ""Yogesh"". Because the wifi name was Yogesh, which can come only when someone already used it. That's very disappointing. I will update my review when I will get New product with good connectivity.",1
"Good Features...

But without gigabit LAN Port it is limited to 100Mbps in wired access point or router mode so what's the use of 733Mbps of wireless bandwidth...

Would be great if it was with the gigabit LAN Port.",3
"Wifi connection not connected.. service provider told that there s error in router.. whn they installed dummy router , then working fine... hw to resolve? Whr to lodge a complaint?",1
Router is good but the power adapter supplied with the router is useless as it is very loose and does not fit any plug point neither wall socket or power strip or UPS or any other plug adapter.,1
I had expected a good performance like a good range and ability to penetrate signal throughout an average size house. It's unexpectedly weak signal doesn't cross more than 1 wall by turning 90 degrees. Range should really have been better.,3
"I thought this is good but not even able to cross a single wall from one floor to another in 50sqft house.. all reviews on internet and YouTube are fake for this product. Tenda-n301 900rs product is better than this expensive 2500‚Çπ product. App is great from tplink easy to setup in 1 min. Can block unwanted device quickly.

Totally wasted my money..",1
Range is very very poor. I bought the one with 5 antenna which is wonderful but this one is quite bad. Just works if u r in same room otherwise quite bad,2
"Cons
1) It is not able to track ip address
2) the setup always fails at the last step
3) the router takes almost 4 - 5 mins to start and reboot (it makes setup more hard)
4) it has heating issue
(I tried every method I knew and also followed every method from official tplink website and YouTube , then I called isp they also said the router was faulty)
Pros
1)range
2)speed",1
"Iam writing this review after using this product for 1 and half month.. As you can make out from the photo itself that, the tp-link AC1200 Archer C6 Wi-Fi router is absolutely new... But currently its not working... It's says 3yrs warranty and replacement.. But nothing has been done yet...

Worst product, worst customer care, fraud company, pls pls pls dont buy this product, its waste of money.",1
Received a defective product and no help from the Amazon team. Moreover the call kept dropping And i ended up explaining this issue to 2 customer care executives yet no solution found. Extremely disappointed. Will take this issue further.,1
"DO NOT get this router if you intend on online gaming regularly or use services such as Discord, etc. It developed a fault within 6 months of purchase and there is always constant packet loss now.

Pinged the router and every 11-12 packets the packets are either lost or ping goes up to 3000ms from 1ms. Note that this is while pinging the router lol, so you can imagine how bad it is when you're actually playing online",1
"1. Unable to connect my 4G dongle.
2. It needs power.
3. It is not like JioFi/Airtel 4G wifi/ you cannot make any usb dongle as wifi.

It is written 3G/4G modem.",3
"One of the worst product ever, the WAN port stopped working after 20 days. Most irritating thing is when h call india tp-link support call, call waits for 10mins to connect, once it's connected some says hi and takes model and version number and then disconnects the call by saying anything.
One of very worst product and service ever

Please don't purchase",1
Worst product. Not up to the mark. I purchased by seeing the positive reviews but those are fake I belive. The 2.4GHZ signal breaks after every 2 to 5mins. 5GHZ works somehow. Gigabit LAN also do not transmit in double speed.,1
"1. Wifi Signal strength is weak.
2. It doesn't penetrate through wall even for 2.4Ghz.
3. Poor range.
4. It usable only in hall. My flat is 1500sqft area. In rooms you won't get proper WiFi signal.
I purchased after seeing review. But I suggest not to buy this product.",1
"I upgraded from my existing TP link WR841 N to this new one.
Wifi range is not that great inside house when compared to my older router.
Intranet speed is better",2
"Easy to intall but range is nit good before taking this keep in your mind.
I have 3bhk flate middle of hall i install this but range capacity is less even in my bedroo its not giving full range so only this issue.",3
"I'd seen many reviews on YT and Amazon itself, but I'm gonna tell you that this 2.4Ghz band is trash. I have a 100Mbps connection but the Speed which comes standing next to the router in the 2.4Ghz band is max 10-30Mbps 90% of the times üòë, though the 5Ghz band is good I get a peak of around 300-250 and sometimes even 400 for a mili second initially at the start of the test on ookla",3
Ok product. Was trying to upgrade to this to get better speed but not much improvement over my current dlink router.,3
I thought this router would have more range than Mi 3C but its worst. I do not recommend this to anyone. It stops working out of nowhere and has to be restarted daily. Very frustrating experience.,1
"Used this for 6 months now with multiple ISPs. This is a very slow router which takes decades to identify a wired connection coming from your ISP. It takes way more time to detect and to connect to wifi. Most irritating thing is, it disconnects very frequently. So if you are a gamer, you can't play a game without any interruption.",2
THE ROUTER DID NOT WORK EVEN 15 FEETS AWAY. TRIED CHANGING MANY LOCATIONS BUT SIGNALS WERE THAT OF AN AVERAGE 2000RS. ROUTER. MOREOVER THE PRODUCT MENTIONED 10DAYS RETURN BUT THE RETURN WAS CLOSED WITHIN 3 DAYS OF DELIVERY. AMAZON CUST CARE IS ALSO NOT RESPONDING.,2
"This is an ok product. If my laptop is near to this router, Speed is good. Signal loses in about 10 to 13 ft distance. Auto rebooted once in a day. Reboots automatically when you are important meeting. I have 100mbps plan. With this router I got 122mbps when I‚Äôm near to it. Overall it‚Äôs an average product",3
"Worst product. 1st time in history I didn't get satisfactory resolution from amazon.
There is problem in connecting to the internet.
I tried contacting to the manufacturer but they are not replying to the call. Wifi signal too week. Its stopped working. Be aware i get damaged product and not providing satisfactory resolution.",1
"Poor WiFi signal not satisfied as I bought this to have good signals to watch Netflix without buffering.
Not satisfied Amazon sent me another pc today but still I am facing same problem.
I can't waist my time in explaining the problems I want my money back.
It's my request.
My old TP-LINK is much better TL-WR841HP.
I SM DORRY I WANT TO RETURN SBD I NEED MY MONEY BACK",1
"Wifi range is very poor for this router, I had purchased this to replace my Netgear router , as this has dual band and better specs, but from the same location of router I am not getting wifi signal in my other 2 rooms in 3BHK house. Router location is in the middle of 2 rooms, but struggling to get consistent signal on even 2.4 GHz. I am now planning to buy something else, wastage of money.",1
"Device heats up during usage, setup is okay. I noticed it perform well on the boundary of original range, within signals are not good. Speed is almost same as original marginal dip. Multi functional modes are very useful and make this device versatile.",3
"The Range Is not good not as expected i am barely getting Wifi Signal in Hall , It is installed in Middle Room Nd I am not getting Coverage.
Connection drops in hall the whole purpose of buying was range but doesn't suffice the need",3
"Looks good. Works fine. Did not see a great improvement as compared to my old Mi R3 which was a single band router. Wall penetration and signal strength did not improve too much as compared to the Mi R3. It is OK, no complaints.",3
Theoretical speed for both 2.4 Ghz & 5 GHz signal should ideally cover 25mtrs of radius however it wasn't even covering 10 ft radius. Not worth the money for sure.,2
"Bought the item to increase the range of my wifi single but it has even poor range than my default modem , router wifi single doesn't reach from my living to bed room. Very poor range , don't even have an option to return the item now.",1
"I had a netgear router previously.. Much cheaper. I do not know if I got a faulty product or what, but the internet connectivity is the worst in this one. Internet doesn‚Äôt even reach my kitchen from the living room. There‚Äôs always an error in the speed test when I get to the kitchen or even my room upstairs. Worst experience ever. Returning it. Not recommended at all.",1
I have Paid for C6 V2.0 but got v3.2 which i was getting for 2000rs but i have paid 2500 for this wrong information is been updated on this product,1
This the product review after using for an year. Product is waste . My internet speed is 130 Mbps . 2 ghz gives 20 Mbps and 5 ghz give 60 Mbps. Signal strength is very week . I am so pissed. Worst is all my network devices struggle to connect. Now a days the speed I get is around 20 Mbps on 5 ghz . I would not recommend this product.,2
"Router stopped working after 1 month of usages, not sure if project was faulty by factory or its seller. My previous TP Link router were so good and this one being so expensive is useless in just 1 month. Not sure what do now, best to avoid buying this from amazon at least.",1
"Tried to set it up 5 times using both laptop and android app. Used their manual, saw YouTube videos, left no stone unturned. But the internet led still glows amber and does not turn green. Hope it's only me who got a defective one.",1
"Not as good as rewiews....specially wifi range with 4 entina and huge prise...very poor with campairing to my old tblink router with two entina and less than half prise

My old and cheper tp link is batter than this one...speciaaly in term of wife range",3
"Wifi signal is ok

As a gigabit router they have mentioned
4 lan ports are gigabit.

I have connected 2 laptop. Speed is capped of at 100mbps

Why ?

It got delivered today and there is no return as well..
Disappointed",1
"Purchased Archer C4000, it's been 9 months that I've been using it without any problem but it started showing up the frequent automatic reset of the Wi-Fi network. It's very inconvenient to rely on this device during this work from home situation. With this price range I expect a really good quality one.",1
I started using the same on 4th January it was working very nice but from 5th January in every one hour the internet was lost for 2 to 3 minutes and after that every 15 minutes internet was getting off of and letter on the Internet was not available for 20 to 30 minutes I contacted everywhere at the end of the day the product was defective Amazon cheated me they didn't help me,1
Issues are there with distance. Where as my previous ISP used to provide ZTE modem with wifi router which had better coverage for 2.5 ghz band. 5 ghz signal stops automatically very often.,2
"Where can I start, I bought this router to increase wifi coverage? Boy was I disappointed. My old 2 antenna Dlink router is performing better which is 5 years old. Yes, I have replaced the product already. Yet same old story. Does not give coverage for 2400 sqft house. Streaming a YouTube video is pain. Waste of money.",1
"Very easy to setup. Getting 100mbps. Solid build quality.For 2500 its only router that has 1 Gig wan port.

But even with 3 antenna does not provide good range. LED indicator are very dim. Takes long time to boot up.",3
Internet led is always orange even after replaced.now no replace option. Now no return/replace option.tp link cust care no also not working,1
Average everyday use router wifi signal üì∂ okeyesh I have a ACT 100 mbps connection Router in dual channel and only upto 60-80 speed only when near by,3
"The WAN port stopped working in less than 8 months. To add to it, TP Link support is one of the worst. Their customer care number never answers. The email support will reply with pre written templates, and would not give resolution.

Amazon/Seller/Users, anyone can help in replacing or returning my router as this comes with a so called 3 year warranty, which I am not able to claim.",1
Initially was happy that I received the product on time. After a month of usage the router is frequently restarting. Amidst the covid times I am not able to take it to service center. It exactly stopped working after the return period. What a waste of money and time!!!. Pls don't buy this. The support system is not up to the mark. Now I have to switch back to my old router.,2
able to connect computer to router with Ethernet cable but no internet and also internet led is off. did not make testing with Ethernet within 10 days from purchase. tp link 3020 is more better than this model,1
"Everything is good. However we need to sign multiple time in case of power cut.

If the owner of wifi and internet holder will available,then other person or guests cannot use it untill he sign in. We should have one time login option,like if once I login even power cut and back I should not login to wifi router it should automatically get connected to devices.",3
the coverage is not good. My office is around 3000 sq feet and there are no walls. Still the signal was not good in the corners.,1
"The product name says, it's a variant with Qualcomm chipset, but i got only the MediaTek variant. It's a significant hardware difference with different capabilities, my goal was to run a OpenWRT which I can't now. Amazon need to get it's act together. On the other hand, a decent product with decent performance.",3
"The picture on the packaging is of A6 and the details are of C6 model. The product also looks like the A6 model.
Not sure if the packaging and look of C6 model has changed or this is just a defective packaging.",1
"4 antenna doesn‚Äôt makes any difference to me.... the range is same as my old two antennas WiFi router!!! Anyways working good, speed is good. Hence 3 stars!!!",3
"I am useing this rougter only 2 hrs. with no problem. But, after that getting Signal is much flactuated. Not constant on Alliance fibre cable. But Fast Delivary. Seller is Good.",1
"We have ordered Archer C6 as its shown in the picture, but we have received other product.",1
"Received broken box inside the Amazon labels packaging. LAN wire was missing incide the box. Router seems already used as no TP link SSID network was accessible, some other network name was finding with no password accepting mode. Very very very disappointed with product & service. As no Refund available hence returning for exchange.",1
"I have purchased this product in the month of May' 2020. It has 2 years of warranty. Now,Wifi router signal is getting hanged. I have to plug out the router for 10 minutes in order to get back wifi signal.

Please resolve the problem ASAP or you guys can replace the product.",3
"This product is rubbish..CPU fluctuating from 10 to 100% now & then. There is intermittent high latency observed even if client is next to router. Extremely poor range, doesnt even cover 20 ft distance.

Going to return this immediately.",1
"After using this for 2 months
This is a average router
5ghz doesn't even cover 1st floor
Don't buy this",1
"After using this router for 7-8 months this routers started giving wifi issues.
its getting wifi issue and stopping broadcast wifi signal very frequently.
i tried resetting and firmware update several time but did not workout.

I do not recommend this product.",1
"All that mimo tech, beam forming, only for advertising. Wifi signal is worse than old simple routers don't know why. This only for close range high speed.",3
Good speed at near range. But worst when you have on other floor. Not good in range coverage. Support dual band that works good and smart switch work smoothly. Then need to work on signal strength as coverage not good.,3
The wifi signals are not very strong on this product. Also the connection/reboot time is longer if there is a power cut. Easily takes upto 3-4mins. Its good only of its placed in a same floor will less number of walls in a house. For a 3bhk size signal strengths are not good and will have to consider and extender.,3
Sometimes its showing that there is no internet connection üòû when I restart the router at that time it again back to normal. Daily this problem is there with this router.,1
I bough this due to the favourable reviews on Amazon. The modem stopped working within 20 days. Needs to be reset every now and then. It‚Äôs better to buy from a retail shop as there is no support from Amazon regarding these issues. Buy Tenda with similar configuration. My WiFi technician said they have encountered numerous issue with TP link WiFi router.,1
"Never Buy signals are poor as well as heating issue..
Support is also not good it takes more than 20 min to answer the call each time.",1
"Delivery ok on time,look stunning, performance bad,and within 6 months stop working,even warrenty of three years no service available,no support at all.Think various time before buying on line....",1
"The 2.4 GHz band keeps on disconnecting from the devices.
5GHz band works wonders. No issues of disconntion with 5GHz band. You will get to know this when you use different SSID for 2.4GHz & 5GHz bands. Even after purchasing gigabit router you fave such kind of issues.",2
"I am using since last 2 months performance wise this router totally disappointed me...
Main issue is WiFi coverage area.
WiFi coverage are for 2.4ghz is very less n for 5ghz its hardly 10-15 meter. If move to one room to another u will loose 5ghz connectivity
Also router take long time to boot",1
"I'm using it as a wifi extender but the connectivity isn't stable at all, after several firmware upgrades it looses connection randomly.",1
I bought this product to replace my 4-year-old tenda router but this thing is so bad that it can't even compete with a 4-year-old router which is around the same price point. I had so many disconnection issues while using this that I refunded it within a week and the 800mbps advertised on 5g is a lie. I have a 350mb connection and even f I sit right next to the router the max I get is 130mb,1
"This is how i received product, supplier sent already returned product. Installation manual is missing, no proper cover and packaging. I tried to connect no LED lights were blinking and network was not showing. Unable to reset router even after pressing reset button for long time. Supplier should check the product is working or not.",1
"My old router was tl-wr840n, I bought this new c6 to get high coverage but its almost same coverage, moreover 5ghz band range is very small so useless, somehow used old router as wifi extender and got good range but at cost of reduced speed",1
"I am disappointed with the router performance, poor range, negligible vertical range. Better use 2 antenna router . 5 antenna is just for show off, there is no use it produces the same range which I was using before TP link WR841. There is no uprage in range and latency is also same . I will not recommend anyone to upgrade with it",3
"Tech support is worst. Also product is not too good. Just if you want a simple router broadcasting dual band signals, then its good.",3
"Tp-link archer C6. WiFi does not work beyond 10 feet, 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz works only if you are in the same room 10ft x 10ft. If you move outside of the room even with just one door separating it stops working because signal is very low.",2
"I've ordered for TP-Link Archer C7 AC1750 but instead of it I got TP-Link Archer C6 AC1200.
I've almost paid double the Rupees 5K /- and got a wrong product which costs half of it.",1
"Router doesn't work properly after 3to5 days. But i did not notice. Yesterday I had noticed that the wifi doesn't connect to mobile most of the time. I have tried reset option. But problem not solved. By the time my return or replacement time expired.
I don't know what to do now?",2
"Range of 5Ghz band is very short. Signal strength will drop considerably even if you‚Äôre in next room adjacent to the router position. Otherwise 2.4G is good, of course with reduced bandwidth.",3
Wifi gets disconnected very often. Reboot time is very long. Range drops without any reason. No difference in dual band. I will suggest go for net gear brand it will be bit costly but you will get product for some few more buks and life will much easy.,1
Better go for tenda at this range tenda is way better in providing speed pings signals,2
The range of wifi is not good. I bought this to replace an old router because it's signal was weak. However I ended up using that routers signals as this is even weaker. Rest all good.,3
After one month of usuage I found the product is not up to the price we paid. Speed in good however the range is seriously worst. I stay in 1050sq house and my router placed in living room at entrance. I get week Signal at master bedroom when using @ 5Ghz but three tower for 2.4Ghz. I was expecting better from TP link for this price. Even I tried all possibilities to align the router for good signal but all effort went vein.... So pls think twice and read other reviews before you buy this product.,2
"Poor signal strength... Not recommended
After 3 months of use,.. don't buy this.. it frequently loses WiFi connection and resets password on is own (in new firmware for it fixed). Overall very poor performance.",2
"It is not even covering 2bhk flat. They have mentioned beam forming network but it is not even reaching my 2nd bedroom, also as discussed with customer care 5ghz network will not cover more than 1 room where it is installed.",1
"Initially I got refurbished product, replaced it once I raised return request and lot of follow-ups but still replaced router also have many issues...
Took this based on reviews but had worst experience with this device, WiFi always disconnects without any network interruptions from service provider.",1
The range is too bad and I got D-Link 825 for same price. It had great coverage and sped is awesome!!!,1
"Wifi Range is too low at this price range. 5G speed is average. Never crossed 60Mbps speed on iphone. Easy to install however, not a worthy buying.",3
"The router looks great, works like charm. The customer care helped in setup and no issues in that front.
I have also connected my HD and can access the contents from any place within range which is great.

The biggest let down is that I got it as I wanted a slightly higher coverage but this does not improve the coverage from my old n150 router.",3
"I had C20. Bought C60. Very funny yet true.. that am getting better performance in my C20 than C60. I wasted my money. 5G signal is pathetic. 2.4G still works sometime.
I read all the reviews and bought it. Seems like many of the reviews are paid review.",1
It's 3 months and now it's dead. Not switching on. Don't know what's wrong with the device.,1
"i have been using this router for almost 2 months now. The network connectivity and signal strength is pathetic. Also, i don't know if there is a problem with the product or the product in itself is defected.",1
Service after sell is very worst as I am experiencing. My router doesnot work but cannot replacement after 10days. So I am trying to contact Tp Link via telephone & Email but no reply. What will I do now??,1
A very good router especially with the facility of USB port file sharing but i am experiencing wifi signal coverage issues. So not upto the mark with signal coverage.,3
"Stops providing internet all of a sudden, have to switch off the router and turn it on again, like twice or thrice a day, very weird. At times it says incorrect password and at times just doesnt connects the wifi. Factory reset, restarting device etc have been already attempted, i think the issue is with device.",3
"Gives great strong signal while i'm in my hall/living room. However if I go to my 2nd floor, then signal doesn't even come 1 bar. So take caution before you purchase it",3
Bill and warranty details are missing.,2
Have to reset if connection is lost for 1 day from provider side but this was not the case with tenda n301. But speed and range wise it is very much better than tenda n301,3
This seller sent an old and used router which was configured already and had a password in it... The box didn't have no seal and it was torn .. I didn't expect to receive old router for the amount of new one..,1
"Actual prodect design is different than product image shown in images.
Why design is different than shown in product description?
Signal strength is very poor even in 1BHK flat around 450 sq ft.",3
"My actual Internet speed is 125 Mbps. Getting same or above the speed if I connect via LAN Cable. After connecting to Router, not getting internet speed more than 30Mbps(i.e. on Wifi) on both of Bands (i.e. on 2.4G and 5G). This product is not worthy to buy.",1
"Amazon sells hardware ver 2 which has issues with upload speed. It gets capped at around 30Kbps irrespective of the available bandwidth for 2.4GHz devices.
Also they don‚Äôt provide refund, only replacement is possible (which‚Äôs of no use bcoz you get the exact same product) so buy carefully.",1
"I bought this one to replace a low powerful DLink router but apart from 5GHz band, it didn't offer any upper hand on my old router. The coverage is still the same with reboot taking lot of time(sometimes even more than a minute)",3
"C6 model
There is a problem with PPPoE connections. There is a way round to connect.
Not recommended for PPPoE connections.
TPLink should look into the matter. Reported by several people already.",3
"Wall penetration is not good. Signal drops even after one wall.
Not worth the money.
Gigabit Ethernet is fast enough.",1
Although the setup and signal strength is good the product broke down in 10days. I am waiting for a replacement from the company.,1
THE WI FI SIGNAL IS VERY POOR AND DOES NOT COVER MUCH OF A AREA AS ADVERTISED..... SPEEDS ARE EXCELLENT AND CONSTANT...,2
"I could still not use the product. Installation for use with a line-in only like a DVD player from a wireless network is not easy as said. May be my ignorance, but could not put it to use, yet.",3
"The wifi speed drops drastically. The speed directly on wire is above 200M. When connected through this crap router drops to 20M even just near the router and on 5g.
Pathetic wifi coverage.
I will never again buy tplink.",1
"WiFi disconnects on its own and all my devices cant connect back until the router is rebooted(which is also extra slow)
I have seen that the WiFi hangs when this problem occurs
I have tried to contact customer service in various ways and get a replacement as it is within 3 years Warranty but they dont respond anyway(email,phone)
So have to buy a new router although this one is well within warranty
No more From TP-Link",1
Please don't opt for this one. It is a defective product. It just kepr rebooting after being fully set up. Got it replaced and the replacement had the same issues. And TP Link customer support was a joke. I would rather find myself in kumbh mela than listen to their bull crap. Requested a return.,1
Box was not packed with regular plastic. Normal tape was used to close. Router had existing password. All clearly indicated that the router was used previously. Not sure if discounted rate was for used items. :(,2
Idk man.. Whenever I plug ig to the ethernet cable it just cause some disturbance in my head. I don't know if it happened to anyone else but please tell me if it's true or just the product is defected... After 10 mins of using it besides me I always feel some kinda disturbance and mild headache,3
The product stopped working after 10 days of usage. Need to take this to Service centre where you need to handover the product for 1 week and need to collect the serviced product after a week. Very poor response from customer care service,1
What is shown on Amazon app and what I got or different in visibility. It is actually like A6 model they're showing.,2
"150mbps speed doesn‚Äôt support on this router via wifi.

Please mention router support speed via wifi accurately to not waste buyer money.",1
"I am using this as an range extender plugged with cat 6 cable. yet it never goes above 100mbps even when the main router is at 300 to 400 mbps. from what i read on multiple forums, it is a common issue with this model. Dont be fooled by the description",1
"Allways ask for the relogin to webpage for internet access. Sucks at signals strength worst signal strength as not as described
Had a lot of issues with this things waste of money",1
Expensive router of TP link and the WAN port got spoiled in 03 moths time and internet could not be connect. Now I am hunting for a service center near my location to replace the router. Dont know how leanghty that process will be. Really disappointed by this product as it started giving complaint so soon.,1
"2.4GZ band does not work properly.Even in front of router 2.4Gz band speed is only 5mbps on 150mbps connection and range is no more than 5 meters.5Gz band works perfectly.
Changed twice, after cust care confirmed the product to be defective,Finally have to return.",1
"Orange light 2-3 times a week, couldn‚Äôt self rectify, has to power off/on and login to ISP again. Its most irritating. Look for a better product in market.",1
"Product just like other routers. Expected mo-mimo technology delivers throughput on Wi-Fi. But this router delivers 70 percent of throughput. This is same what I got in drink 816. So don't buy and don't waste money. Also no return policy these items , and can't able to buy advanced model.",1
"the WiFi range is quite limited in the house.
Maybe it is designed only for the single rooms of hotels.",3
"3 star's , Firstly the design was defferent tat I hv received , it's not as shown in images. But the model was same C6. Why..?",3
The customer support team of tp-link is very unhelpful. This router stopped working within 8months of purchase and I tried to connect with the customer service teams of both tp-link and Amazon. No one responded. Given the price of the router compared to others the support teams should be more responsive.,1
Me purchased this router for my home. Ground floor works perfectly. first floor i am getting signal only 25%. It's very weak. Adjusted many arrangements by not only antenna but configuration also. Still no hope. Sorry to say..very disappointedüòî,2
"The wifi signal is from the router is not consistent, you need to reboot it every now and then, hopeless product",1
It's easy to set up and make working. How ever.. not working as expected. I have ACT 100Mbps connection. When I try directly I got 99Mbps but when I connect to this WiFi router.. getting 75Mbps in laptop and 55Mbps in Mobile.,3
"Don‚Äôt go for the rating! The product claims ‚ÄúNo Dead Wifi zones‚Äù. Don‚Äôt fall prey to this promise.
This is a sheer lie! Signal doesn‚Äôt reach in other parts of the house. Moreover it‚Äôs s Chinese product!",3
"Hi, I order TP link Archer C6 gigabit router .
First thing it is not the same wbat I orderU can the Image in my order and secondly it is not working properly. The connectivity is very poor. I want to return the product.

24/3/2021
Plz arrange delivery Asap, I want to return the product.",1
"Irrespective of Claimed specifications and technology, it's no better than my 5 year old router in terms of performance.",3
After 15 days it stopped working.,1
"I was using a D-Link router prior to this and decided to upgrade my router to this particular model.Honestly I did not notice better range,reception,speed for the same set of parameters hence wondering why I paid a premium",2
"I bought this router for 150Mbps connection it works properly I givr 5 star for it, but i received used product with full of dust, fingerprint, scratch's and not even reset their credentials. I feel very bad for this kind of selling used products in the name of new products.",3
I have purchased this router and after 10 days or so it keeps on disconnecting on its own and you need to restart it. Very pathetic router my earlier single band router was way better though it was from tplink. The return period is also over or else I would have returned it.,1
"My previous wifi router was able to provide network coverage across all of my rooms. But this one is not able to do so, once there is a wall you can not get the coverage. So plz try for some more alternative.",1
"I am already using a wifi router issued by my service provider, being impressed by the description of TP Link AC1200, I planned to upgrade to ""TP Link AC1200"" but disappointed my house is not covered fully, but it was covered by my earlier router.",1
"The product which i got couldn't even connect to the internet
Put all my detail correctly with p2p connection provided by my isp
Wan port lose , cable wasn't getting fixed , couldn't even get connected via WAN

Pathetic product...",1
"Utterly BAD product!!
Bought it for 200mbps plan usage.. its just can't stop REbooting after every 50mb download.
You just can't watch even a YouTube video bcoz it keeps rebooting out of the blue and forget watching Netflix on it.",2
"When set to Access Point mode, it loses 99% of its functionality, including wireless MAC filter and FTP server for USB drive. Very buggy if set to Router mode. E.g. disabling DHCP makes wireless clients lose internet access.

Not recommended. Go for Asus RT-AC series instead.",1
Do not buy this product.... I am getting request time out since day one... I reached tech support and they just asked me to change frequency.. And still same issue.... I would suggest get one dlink Or any other router... I had a very bad experience... It's almost 1.5 month now still same issue...,1
Speed delivered as per network but WiFi not having signals strength as expected. Which is the main function of any WiFi device.,2
Now Dualband router with less than Rs2000 does have range extender capabilities. This one doesn't have it. Search for WDS mode is tedious task also software setup is buggy for WDS mode. Also there is no return policy as product.,1
Very bad and faulty product. The WAN port seems faulty as it drops the incoming internet connection always. It also pushes off the wireless connected devices(clients) often. The repair guy tried to fix it like 3 times but couldn't. DO NOT BUY this model.,1
It was a disappointment buying this and I have already initiated return. My D link DIR-816 did almost similar job compared to this which is 10 times more expensive.,3
There's a major issue with this router. The guest network keeps turning itself off. It's super annoying and is a major deal breaker. I wouldn't recommend it just got this reason.,1
Not at all recommended. Using it since last 2 month. Router is dropping the signel oftentimes and once it lost the signel it will became nightmare to re-connect. Sometimes it disconnect automatically in running operations. Overall built in quality of the product is also very poor.,1
"Normal signal strength. don't see much use for me. when the power goes down it will take time to reboot. around 2 mins. Another normal Router.

ok product.",3
Range is not at all good. I couldn't get signal in next room even though it had 4 antena to boost the signal. Returned the product. Very disappointed.,1
after one month of purchase one LAN port not working .when i visit service center in kolkata they takes almost two months and gave me a used scratch product the serial number of the product not the same.it means its a used product of other.very bad service.its my humble request please dont buy this and go for D-LINK far batter then this.,1
I have 60 Mbps connecting but after 3 days of using this router my network speed is getting lower than 10 Mbps and greeting ping loss in every minute's. and amazon doesn't ship this product with any box this router come with only retail box with tearing plastic wrap.,2
"It's ok product, but it couldn't cover my smart tv at living room. Which is just12-13 feet away. I have buy wifi extender",3
It was supposed to be an upgrade for my 6 yr old dlink wifi router. But this performs way slow and has less range than the old one.not happy with the performance.,2
The first order was replaced and the replacement one isn't new. The packing of white plastic wasn't there and looked like refurbished product. The same problem occurs.,1
 Content was not delivered in its original packing,1
"Writing review after 1.5 years, the 5ghz signal is good, but range is low. The 2.5ghz signal sometimes drops but range is fine. It is basic ac router. I'm waiting for stable firmware patch. I got 2 or 3 patches but the problem is still there.",3
Speed doesnot even cross 30mbps. Not satisfied. Even after placing the router in correct position same issue occurs,2
Used non functional product was sent. Retured it as the product was not powering on at all.,1
"I bought this modem in Feb2020 and it does not work now in May 2020 which is less than 3 months. 3k for 3 months is too much, it is useless product. i dont recommend anyone to go with this. I was having a spare DLINK modem which was working even after 2 years. Useless product !!!!!",1
"Not happy with the product. Ours is a big house and the signal strength in the corners is very weak. It works same as my 10 yrs old router, no different. The lockdown started just after I bought it, so could not return and now I am stuck with it",1
"I‚Äôm not giving any star as this was a used product was repacked and sent. It was not a new router.
Surprised to see such good packing to make the product seem new.
The router was not reset because of which I got to know it was a used product.",1
Either i received a faulty product.....or this product should be avoided. Complained to the Co. also...and they said they cannot comment on teh online product....who is then selling to Amazon ?????? TP Link distributor or the Co. itself ???,1
"Such a pity product. Why reboots itself?
It does interrupt the internet usage. I hate this. No such settings menu to stop these random reboots. Otherwise signals are good.",1
"This router came with a 3 year warranty. It has not even lasted one year! Please NEVER purchase this product.

Thelma Cardoza",1
Stopped working after 1 year use. Called customer care as the product is still in warranty but didn't get any help from them either. Now I cannot use internet and tp link team cannot send any technician at home ( its not in their policy ),1
"Third class reception, not even recommend for house... It should be used only for a single room",1
The wifi range is not enough for a 2 bhk home. You will require extenders for a good signal.,3
"Certainly the most overrated product on Amazon u can see, it's so rediculas can't even able to deliver a proper wifi signal in my 2bht house... I bought after so much research and i found this but seriously so disappointed with the performance not recommended to anyone",1
I wanted the Qualcomm version of archer c6 v2 but they delivered me dual processor of archer c6 v3 so not very happy with purchase they fooled me twice with the same product,1
"I have 3 BHK flat, range is not great, it is fitted in lobby and trust me with just one wall you van't get range at 4 meters. so be careful.",3
Received used product along with previous person bill üôÇ,1
if you are unable to get good signal strength in all rooms then what's the use of all the fancy things it promised to provide.,2
I purchased it on the 8th of April and it stopped working on the 23rd of April. I believe this product is not worth the money nor will it solve the purpose. We don't know who to connect with for a problem.,1
"Superior coverage. Rich features. Gets warm at the bottom though. And frequent dropping of the connections, might be due to the fault in firmware or something like that. No updates either.",2
"The quality of the product TP Link Archer C1200 Dual Band Gigabit Wireless Cable AC1299, Broadcom Chipset, VPN, WiFi Router delivered was POOR.
It did not even switch on.
The replacement has not even been shipped so far.
This company has very POOR service. Unfortunate.",1
"It‚Äôs been a month only, assuming this is brand new but seems like a defect the WAN port which is used to connect to Internet cable blinks Orange. Seems like manufacturing defect pieces was disturbed and since this is more than 10 days there is no replacement.",1
"Version 3 has a lot of problems. My router shut down in 5 months. I have replicated it from the service center and now I have brought version 4, it is working well.",2
"One item was missing, firstly I ordered it, but then there was some problem, so I exchanged it, and after that adapter was missing, now I am not getting it replaced, what if the another router also has some problem, but not that much happy. And this router is working fine now.",3
"Features like parental control don't work so not worth buying this as routers with same features are available with 1000 Rs less
For instance D-Link DIR-825 ac1200.",1
Extremely disappointed. Does not have the range or the speed transmission it claims to have. Missed the return window and would like a refund or a replacement with a better product. Have used TP link and have been satisfied but very disappointed with this purchase.,1
Range is PATHETIC. I guess the antennas are only for aesthetics. OVERPRICED. HYPED. DON'T BUY.,1
Wifi 2.4 ghz band is always fluctuating. Need to restart every time. Tp extender can not register the signal once it says ip address can not be assigned.,1
Low end versions are superior than this version. Not sure why they make dual band routers of such low quality.,3
The range is nothing extra ordinary. The most annoying thing is the random reboot. It just gets rebooted at any time.,1
"Very poor in the range just cover the 100 sqrt bedroom, pathetic router in 2500. Total loss of money.",1
Failed within the warranty period and no solution from Amazon/Tp-Link/Appario retail Pvt ltd even though it is Fulfilled by Amazon.,2
"If you are looking for a router with good coverage which has to span rooms/walls , then this may not be a good one. 5ghz signal becomes weak in 5-6 meter, 2.4ghz performs ok. Apart from this router is fine , if you are looking good performance then his one the one for you.",3
"It had some interference with the signal. Startup time is too long.
After 6months 2.4Ghz automatically disconnects after 24-30hrs... u need to reset every time, then it starts working again. -_-
Trash product. Cant even rollback the Firmware upgrade.",1
I had installed this router in my house but withing 15 days of installing wifi stopped functioning. Its very hard to find out the service support. Now its lying unused in my house.,1
We received a defective product. But we were too late to identify that and Replacement window was closed. Seller cheated us. It gets rebooted every 4 hours and should manually turn it on. It's very irritating. Becareful before you purchase. Better go for Netgear routers.,1
I got thid product 1 month before. Product was good and quality also was good. But after 7 days it start hang. Every day once or twice i have to restart it. Cos network get disconnect automatically. Problm is with router not with service provider.,3
Adapter was faulty. Still it was urgent for me so I didn‚Äôt return the item.,1
I am disappointed with this router. Way too expensive for very little performance. I have 200mbps bandwidth but rarely the router will give me more than 170mbps even iam right next to the router. Range is the worst part. Should be good for 2bhk not for 3bhk.,2
i don‚Äôt know how the router dead after 7days. after 7 days once power blackout happened the router doesn‚Äôt connect to internet. after lot of restart decided to return. very careful about this similar issues who ever purchase.,1
"Worst experience ever, very poor quality of signal.. hardly 1or 2 rooms coverage",1
"I can‚Äôt understand how this product can have such a high rating especially when there are tons of the same complaint all over the Internet about WiFi issues with this Router.

Pls don‚Äôt buy this router unless you don‚Äôt need WiFi. Coz WiFi simply doesn‚Äôt work with this router.",1
"Upgraded to latest firmware v1.3.5 and router started misbehaving, suddenly disconnects all the devices and doesn't allow any connection till next reboot.",3
"It gives the speed but range is not very good.

Same hall it is ok but I get disconnected frequently in next room not 5 meter away.",3
i had router 500 rs it was perfect then i bought this expensive router and become foolish,1
"Hello,

I had ordered the Archer C6 normal one. The original and the replacement both were Incorrect. I've been Delivered a TP Link Archer C6 ""MESH"" Router. Please check the product before shipping out.",1
"Signal strength is worst, can't even get the right signal in next room not even at 20 feet distance. 2 antena was better than this model. I won't recommend to anyone üëéüëé",1
The signal is weak . Sometimes internet disconnects and the speed is very low although I have internet package of 100 mbps,2
Within a year the router is giving me issues. I keep getting error WAN port unplugged. When its plugged very well. After resetting the router it works for a few hours and then the same issue. No kind of support available from TP link. Very disappointed.,1
I am facing frequent signal drops every day with my Alliance Broadband and will need to replace this item. Hope the replacement works.,2
I replaced my faitly new router with this because it has 1 G speed now this keeps dropping every now and then back to wasting my money,1
"I must say the worst choice I have made for WiFi. First of all I have change the router twice and now after using this few months its not working now. And service center is more of irritating seriously.dont go with this, its better to buy cheeper one but not tp.",1
"The router after using for 5 days, got a problem with power and stopped working, connecting to the internet. And by then the product return date was expired, hence couldn't return back or exchange to a new one. A big disadvantage buying product online I realized.",3
"The Wifi Singal strength is very poor in 450 Sq feet area. It cost me around 2.5k and this type of performance is not acceptable at all.

Whatever mentioned in the product box or other documents are only works on paper.

Very disappointed...",1
This Router is not working properly. I am not getting wifi signal less than 10m. I am not happy with the performance of this router. Pls replace with other one of same modle or refund.,1
"I like to compact design.
Adapter look like not original
Router is dirty and looks like used one.
In box Ethernet cable is missing.
Router Pack was already open.",1
"Storage sharing options stopped working after few days, because of the return window being ten days only cannot return also. Cannot access the storage sharing ip as per the manuals provide.",1
When you'll start with it it will be very good just after a few days it will not work either the normal 2.5ghz port or the 5ghz port so I would suggest don't buy as there is no after sale service and the seller is also not good I hope this is fake,1
I received a faulty piece. I don't see any mention of warranty. It was purchased 3 months ago. How do I replace it now?,1
"There are just too many WiFi drops.
Ridiculous.
Have tried everything from reconfiguring to resets.
The WiFi just drops constantly.",1
"This Product does not support sim. You would need another 3g/4g dongle for internet..
Not able to return the Product as well..",1
comparing prize not much poerfull signal average product.,2
This archer C6 version is not good is reboots in every 1 hr. I replaced the product but every product had same problem so I returned. But later I bought TP link archer A6 both are exact similar and TP link archer A6 is working awesome.,1
"Nice product, wifi signal strength is strong. Dual band works perfectly. I use 7 devices and all works at 45-65 Mbps speed. I use for gaming and general purpose and find this wifi best for upto 7 devices.",3
"After 2 months usage.
Wifi signal get reset or drop randomly
Interface could get easy however not user friendly
Using 100 Mbps line 5G network is weak as compared to other routers.",3
"WiFi signal for 2.4 GHz is lower than my old router, 5 GHz is much lower, so returned immediately
Don't Buy",1
Device hangs multiple times in a day. There is a lag in the signal output despite of having high broadband speed,2
"Faulty product delivered by Amazon, post 2 weeks router takes more than 45mins to boot afterward also wifi signal doesn‚Äôt start. Return policy expired hence can‚Äôt return back, Amazon should verify seller products as name of company is used to sell faulty products.",1
My isp provided me 20 mbps plan when i start the device he provide me 9 mbps only when i ethernet cable out from wan port then again put ethernet cable in wan than provide me a 20 mbps speed every time when i on the router,2
Many features like bandwidth management and ratelimiting that are present in older tplink routers are totally missing. And just to have a neq webinterface the functionlity has been thrown away.,2
"The Wifi range is not even good. I was using D-Link DIR-615 model earlier which was just for Rs. 1000/- and the range was great with only 2 antenna. However I was expecting better range than D-Link.

Really upset with the wifi range.",1
"Router Reboots frequently
no proper support from tplink
signal strength was poor
better to avoid it",1
"In place of tp-link archer c6 router, ti received a D-Link 2 antenna router in the box. I have ordered for replacement and waiting again.",1
Range is poor,2
I got a defective product. No return policy. Suggest buying it from local shops. Price is actually better there and you atleast know u r getting from someone reputed...i was promised a replacement with the return policy. But that never came..,1
Stopped working after 2 weeks . 2.4 hz is dead slow while 5hz works fine.,1
"my wan port stopped working after a year ... no internet signal
it was may be due to some power fluctuation during rain",3
Not compatible with non-fiber broadband lines... Also my 12 year old wifi router had a better coverage than this..,1
Very good signal but u will face one problem if ur mobile or other device don't support 5ghz band than u will not get good speed. Samsung mostly mobile doesn't support 5ghz band.,3
"The speed on 5.0 is good but need be in same room as the router getting 200mbps+.
2,4 ghz max speed is 50 mbps on channel 11 if set to auto it drops to 25mbps.
range is what i have the issue which",3
"There is too much disconnection and restart of device. To fix the problem had to disable Nat, used less but still constantly restarting",1
"Faulty product, unable return the product and connect service.Amazon should take needful action on such china made item.

these are not trustworthy brand sold by amazon.

I must share this in FB so Frnd should not buy from amazon such products.",1
"I am having old TP-LINK TL-WR840N and compare to that Archer C6 Gigabit useless. That old one is very good signal strength.

I dont have the option otherwise I will return this product.",2
The internet connection keeps going off. The connection light goes orange every day atleast once. As per my internet service provider the issue is with the router as all of their customers who are using this router are facing the same issue.,1
"This doesn‚Äôt provide service after certain period. Signals are dropping, resets automatically, speed went down badly. Not sure if there is any customer care who can address. Was excellent initially but after some period giving trouble",2
"I think you go for d-link router because my previous d-link router overall i used 5 yrs but still d-link router is working, when i buy this tp-link it doesn't make me happy...",1
"DO NOT buy this product. It randomly stops working. TP Link customer care is not available either on call, in person or on email. You will be stuck after spending money.",1
Do not buy this router if you are looking for Wifi. Tried all the possible combinations. Wifi performance is very unstable. My older D-link with 2 antena gives wider coverage and stable signal strength.,1
"Upgrading from a N300 router, i thought this router will give me a good range. But alas.
In my 1320 sq ft flat, it cant pass one single wall and go to my bedroom with teh door closed.
returning the product",2
Till now it‚Äôs a good product but will have to wait for a week to give a positive feedback,3
Not capable of what is advertised i feel the 5 star reviews are just fake ones. Poor signals. Basic router (the old one which I had ) it much more efficient.,2
"Disgusting service by tp-link. Think before you buy. If you face any issues, you would probably look to buy another router as their service is pathetic",2
"When connected to other modems my internet is working fine, but when I plugin my internet cable to this modem, it gives me WAN port is unplugged.
Forget about speed it doesn't even connect to the internet.",1
OK.. so far I didn't even get 5ghz speed it's simply a hoax. 2.4ghz wokrs fine and when you switch on it takes minimum 5min to start,1
I'm living in a 3 floored building. I've installed the device in the middle floor. Both the above and below floors do not receive any WiFi signal at all. I bought this hoping it provides better range than this. Pathetic.,2
Internet modem not working kindly refund my money,1
I bought this product to replace a router fitted by my internet service provider for better wifi signal but it's not fulfilling my need. So if it's possible can you replace it by your another product AC1350-Archer C60.,3
5 GHz connection seems good but 2.4 GHz Band performance is pathetic with frequent disconnections and very very average range. This is the first time I'm using TP-Link most probably this will be the last time too.,2
The router is good but the only issue that I am facing is that when the router powers on its pretty slow. TP link need to check or upgrade the board,1
"Getting 169. IP even after multiple resets.
No option for replacements

Worked only for a week

Need a replacement",1
Stopped working within 10 days of purchase. The customer care won‚Äôt respond to your calls for help. Worst experience during WFH.,1
The signal drops drastically ..The coverage is not even 15 ft,2
"Not able to connect to isp (PPPoe). It always say wrong I'd or password.
My old router was working fine, but for this router tried many things, but unable to connect to ISp",1
Looses connectivity on 5ghz or 5g mode i am using it on lower bandwith and is working fine‚Ä¶ range is low,3
I have purchased WiFi router on 4 th November and it was working fine for one month den It was not at all connecting to my office desktop m really fed up.,1
"I bought this router in jan 2020, not even 6 months this router worked properly, it‚Äôs June 2020 now, router is switching on now , there any issue with signal drop and WiFi is disconnecting , this Ian useless router",1
"Product details page has wrong information. It says 2 usb ports whereas only 1 port is available ( see screenshot attached).
The device gets super hot in idle state without even setting up the internet. Didn't try anything else .",1
"1. WIFI signal range is poor, for an expensive router
2. Device is getting heated upon usage.
3. Deveice is too big and bulky.",3
"Archer c6 is creating a hidden network in same channel as regular WiFi. the performance if wireless is bad too. Maybe I might have got a detective itemüôÅ

Wired gigabit Ethernet achived960Mbps",3
"older model dlvrd. see photo.
i missed return date and now amazon dont want to accept their mistake",1
"The internet speed provided by the router is really good, however the range is not good enough. It is good for a home of around 90-100 Sq Yrds...",3
Got it a couple of weeks ago and it's shutting down automatically within 3 weeks,1
Looks te product is flawed..It went for a toss within the first 23 days of purchase.,1
"WiFi signal is too poor, used to have a mi router before this, and it's safe to say that the range of the mi router was at least twice of this. Apart from that, speed on the 5ghz band is lossless and there have been no packet drops, seamless browsing!",3
"After three months, the WAN port went down. After firmware upgrade and troubleshooting with technical support still the issue was not resolved.. so but some other model or some other product to save your money.",1
"Keeps showing no internet on regular basis but after reconnecting shows internet.
Range is ok. Seems like doesn't work well with broad band services like nextra",3
"Configuration was easy however, the signal coverage is very less, device has to be with 6 to 7 meters to get good connection. More than that signal is very low and intermittent disconnection.",1
"Worst product ever, no doorstep service available like other branded devices, such a cheap company, alws shows problem in the adapter, and gets reboot every few hours, what a waste of money and time... No one should buy it...",1
"I dont like this. Not user friendly very difficult to setup each every time settings needs no change, using though idea dongle. I purchase this only to use with cctv hike vision but not yet i cant connect. So its now resting on my cupboard.",1
"Good router for the price. Gigabit speeds and MIMO.
Recent firmware is not good . Software is enabling Alexa and hidden access point by default.
One good thing is you can install open-wrt.",3
"The router was good but it stopped working after 15 minutes. And also it was preconfigured by someone and the surface of the router was scratched. Really disappointed, Now I have to wait for the refund till that my internet data would be wasted.",1
"Not getting the full signal to very opposite room with which my 600 bucks worth tplink router gives.
Bought this one based on the reviews now totally regret.",2
"The service on this device was very bad, i was getting 30Mbps on a 200Mbps plan while the router provided by the company was able to give me 120+ Mbps , also user manual was missing.
Very disappointed in tp link.",1
Router performance is not same as published by manufacturer. It hangs frequently. Wifi signal strength is not good. Signal does not reach even beyond 14-16 feet. Find better alternative for performance.,2
WiFi Signal is not so great as said in the description is almost similar and even poor then the router available at cost of 1000/- to 2000/-. After month use am adding to it as very poor product. Don‚Äôt buy at all,1
Checked to see if product works after 15 days and its not working. No replacement !!,1
I bought this router in the mid of June 2020 and The WiFi keeps disconnecting by itself and my technical guy checked and informed me that there is a problem with the router. Please send me a replacement for the same.,1
The signal strength drops like a rock the moment you move away from direct view of the router. Does not even hold the strength to beyond 12 feet.,2
The device worked fine for 20 days and it stopped working suddenly.Amazon dint help me to get it replaced as it had 10 days exchange policy. I had to give to the service center on my own and waiting for replaced one to arrive.,1
Bought this WiFi device 11 days back and after working for 11 days it has thrown up a defect and is not usable anymore. The Amazon return for this product ended 3 days back and now I am stuck with this defective device. Avoid this device.,1
Dont go for it. Stopped working after 6 months of usage.,1
1star,1
Pathetic product. Fake claims as mentioned on YouTube or online.. waste of time replacement product is also turned out to be same.,1
"It is not a portable, it's works only in Ethernet connection, wrong picture in ad as traveling router with pant pocket,i am disappointed,i am returning the router,I want refund",1
Product is not good. It stops working after 15 days. Now tech support is requested to visit service center during this pandemic situation very disappointed with the service and support,1
"I Dont know Wat The Problem Is but Work Fine Fore Couples Weeks Suddenly From Morning its Not , Searched For Return Option It Say It Is Closed before One Week ,If The Seller Sees This Compliant I Just Need Replace Of Product",1
Product is great but didn't get Ethernet cable in box. I didn't expect that it will be missing,3
This router has something wrong with wifi connectivity.. It hangs a lot time.. Stop responding to a specific device..,1
What I dislike about this router is that it takes lot of time to connect to the internet. I do have a 300 Mbps speed internet and my earlier router of two antenna was super fast in connecting.,2
After 15 days problem in 2.4 GHz band .Do not buy there is problem is 2.4 band afere some time,1
" I received i used product, product was not packed, and its not working properly I am facing problem",1
"Not just this..Dont buy TP link router itself...
I have changed couple of TPLink routers in last 3months....same problem...The latency is too high.
The support is pathetic.",1
There is a critical firmware issue in this device and it can compromise your network security. Tech support people are not able to fix this issue. So don't waste your money.,1
I'm not able to enter into a PUBG match when I changed my router to this one. I'm not sure what firewall settings are blocking it I habe tried each and every solution that could be possible and still facing the issue.,3
"Do not work with all devices, very difficult to setup",1
Wifi signal drops abruptly very frequently. Even the signal is not consistent as specified . Also not sure why I am not eligible for refund but only option for replacement. I don't need this faulty product.,1
Hi I bought this product in Nov20 and not even 2 months its adapter is unserviceable.Not at all expected this from a reputed company product.,1
Not so good product. Never connects on time. Always frustrating. Always says wrong password even though the password is right.,2
Be careful. This router might not be compatible with your ISP. Consider making enquiries beforehand.,1
Disgusted with this product. Bought this because I wanted to increase my internet speed and the older box didn‚Äôt support it. This is worse! I had better internet access with my older box. Please don‚Äôt get this.,1
Router had problem while connecting to television and it got disconnected for every 5 minutes and again i need to switch off and on the tv to connect the wifi and its working fine for mobile without any issue.,1
I expected the range of the router to be good. I'm in the next room to the router but surprisingly the range is poor. My less expensive router has a better range.,2
Wifi is very unstable. Literally using my cat5 cable for important meetings,1
This is not a good product. Range is same as 1200 rs router. Stopped working after a month,1
"After installing, signal is breaking every now and then. While checking with service provider, hhey are telling that received piece is defective piece. Also, return date is over, please guide how to rectify this issue.",1
"I have Huawei wifi router which came with Airtel broadband. I bought tp-link router to extend signal but it's signal is weaker than that of Huawei one. There is no option to return, waste of money.",1
Didn't find it as good quality. Every 3-4 hours it stops broadcast of ssid and will resume after power restart. Range also isn't that great. Mine is hardly 11 months old and the problem stated 3 months back.,2
It is difficult to set up. Have to call Internet Service provider as it does not provide DCPH connection option. Have to set up connection for Alliance Broadband using Static IP,2
Did not really feel that boost in signal strength. Most mobiles (which are not very latest) did not even detect the 5G band and this was no where mentioned on the product page on Amazon.,3
One of the worst products I have purchased ... On a plan of 100mbps it gives a speed of 1mbps DONOT WASTE your money... The customer service is pathetic,1
To much drama around it but not so effective,1
"It is just not connecting, they have written it is V2 but I got v3.20 and no matter how I try it isn't connecting and showing limited connection and when I try my old D-Link router with same settings it is working.",1
"Please don't buy
Go for Tenda 10
The signal strength is very weak
2.4 wife signal is very short like 5G
üò¨üò¨üò¨üò°üò°",3
"One fine day it just decided it didn't want to power on anymore. The power light keeps blinking but nothing further. TP Link support in inaccessible and none of the troubleshooting tips have helped.

RIP",1
"Will not recommend this to anyone.

Setup is troublesome.

Service support is hopeless.

Herculean task to get through the ivr.",1
Device is good. But the connection always cut. In a hour 4-5 times connection gets distrupted. Did I need to replace the product. Please help me. Only 10 days replacement is available,3
Box packing was not good. We found insects and bugs inside the box and also the device is not working and seems to be used one. Not sure on what basis Amazon is describing as the best seller.,1
ssd pasword not correct. cant connect to modem.ordered a replacement. customer care does not care,1
Product is dead within 30 days of purchase noone is offering for replacement neither Amazon not seller and TP-Link providers are saying service centre closed so cannot help will not recommend to buy this product,1
"Good range, for that only reason bought it, speed not that great might be my ISP not giving that good speed",3
The router does not work on 2.4 ghz. Devices get internet hardly for 5 minutes and then disconnect. This router is unusable for 2.4 ghz and there are lot of devices that only work on 2.4ghz.,1
"No difference using my old router from Airtel and this one, not good range, other old routers provide the same range, so waste of money buying this router",1
"The first time I bought it conked in 181days just 1 day after the warranty period. These products are meant to last. So I ordered another one subsequently. Company needs to replace the 1st one, it's only fair.",1
"Wifi signal has issues which disconnects the devices multiple times and its common complaint all the users have as per google search.

Unreliable product. Please review before purchasing it.",1
"Easy to setup and get connected.
5G band wouldn't work even if you are in the same room. 2.4G is kinda okay. Over all was not satisfied with the router had to return.",3
"Having issues with quality of Port,Multiple attempts by service provider to use different cable lugs ..final cause was port quality connectivity not good. maybe a case of poor manufacturing",1
Product is unstable. Resets automatically after few hours and you need to configure again. If u try installing thru to link app you have to agree for tplink to collect data without your knowledge.,1
Not worth as it is being said. Still I don't get good signal bin my bedroom.,3
They are cheating by mentioning Qualcomm chipset in the title. It is not Qualcomm chipset but Ralink+Mediatek chipset,1
They don‚Äôt provide the range despite the antennas. They took a while to install but it‚Äôs the range issue in my room was not resolved and hence returned it. They‚Äôre good for smaller homes.,3
Modem gets hanged suddenly and internet stops working. I bought it 20 days back and was not able to use it as I was out station. Now can‚Äôt return the product either and very bad. Would suggest not to buy this,1
"Not a good router . WiFi speed fluctuations, ping time too high.
No technical support. After knowing the fact that speed fluctuations is due to router...Really disappointed.",2
very short range in both 2.5 and 5ghz disappointing in this but when am in range it gives me best internet speed and gaming experience low ping in pubg around 20 ping but range is short,3
The router is not switching on rather it switches on and immediately switches off. Not sure what to do now. This is the very first time on unpacking.,1
"The product boasts of with 3 signal antennas which are not worthy, the signal reception is hardly under 10m. Should have gone for an other product ..regret buying this.",2
"The device itself works fine, but the performance is not to the level I expected based on the reviews, so they are a bit misleading.

Also the spec in the description is wrong, there is only 1 USB port, not 2.",3
"I feel this modem isn't worth that money, we may get better ones for this price, WiFi signal even in 2.4Ghz band is also not that good.",2
I needed to use this router as extended router without cable connection. Meaning have a primary router & need to use uplink as extended router without connecting any cable from primary router. Kindly advise,3
Cant believe why I brought this piece,1
Expected wifi range is not delivered with this product .. but for me its enough for my home . Easy to install good bandwidth utilisation provided .,3
Older devices which can connect only on 2.4 GHz wifi often run into problems connecting to this wifi. It's been over a month now but haven't figured out the solution!,1
This router is not wifi extender though it is mentioned.,1
Very weak signal and drop in lan speed,1
"Received a defective router. After two months of usage, wifi network and internet are frequently disconnecting and auto restarting. Not recommend.",1
this wifi has big problem. its 5ghz network shuts down and restarts on its own. its a faulty model also my jio as well as my Vodafone sim not working through dongle. do not buy this 750 router.,1
"The router stopped working after the firmware update! It just bricked, factory reset did not make difference. It stayed on only for 30 mins. TpLink is turning to be a disappointment.",1
"Better than D-Link I had earlier, signal strength is still not that great but speed is on the mark.",3
This router doesn‚Äôt work properly and is having frequent disconnection problem,1
The WiFi coverage is very bad and seen frequently disconnected.,1
After 17 days working good today it suddenly stopped 1. Adapter not working or the entire system is not working. Calling the customer service now,1
"Provided the used detected product, no installation guide present on the box no plastic wrap around the box. Router covered in all dust and dirt.",1
Within a month the wifi stopped working changed the adapter and then the next adapter provided blew up. The service centers are in grant road and vasai. Hope some one is listening,1
"There is a speed issue over 2.4ghz band, 5ghz works good, i have 50mbps plan getting around 5mpbs ~ 17mbps over 2.4 and over 5ghz almost 50mbps. 27 aug 2020. With latest firmware.",1
Total waste not WiFi signal work 1200,3
I feel my Router is damaged as its range is quite small and it can't be accessed in 9mtr distance from the router on WiFi.,2
No proper response from call center it is not working properly link is fluctuating internet team claims issue with device,1
It's not supported with UBB Dongle so be very careful if you're purchasing for that purpose.,1
Its nothing better than the older one I had been using for 6 yrs,3
You can not set bandwidth limit of your connected devices only you can set device priority. This is a very basic router feature. Don't know how TP link launched this without proper bandwidth control,3
"2 stars Because of low range of 2.4 ghz and nil 5 GHz.
My mi 3c is 20 times better than best routers out there, but only 300 mbps capacity.",3
I was happy at first but 5ghz band stopped working...i returned the router. Sad about the defective piece delivered to me but again i went with to link router different model. Let's see how it goes,3
"Does not reach the last bedroom
Have to use an extender",3
"Product doesn‚Äôt perform as described
Iball baton in comparison is a way better option",1
The router I received is completely different than what they show here in the image. Even the replacement was same.,1
Not satisfied with range.. especially through walls. When in range speed is good.,2
Stopped working after 1.5 years . Also wifi strength is too low and not constant,1
"Worst Product, at 2.4Hz - speed is less that 40 and disconnecting each and every after 15 min.
5 Hz works fine but only if you sit beside the router hardly works only for 5 m range",1
My wifi is rebooting every minute. No tech support from TPLINK as their Indian Customer Care is not servicable right now as I tried to call them many times. Worst Product & Worst Customer Service,1
Product to achcha hai but ye har usb mordam ke sath nahi canect hota hai ap log pro lene se pahle compny bat kar lena kiyo ye refunded nahi hai jaise ye irvine4g ke nahi nahi chalta hai,2
The product stopped working after twig weeks. It's got stuck in some state where I cannot log in to the system more can I reset it. Terrible product. DO NOT BUY THIS.,1
Dont buy this product range of wifi is limited to only 1 room.Too bad,1
"Recived in Router cover already removed inside box . Scratches is on router. It seems got used products. Replacement order placed now waiting for new delivery.
Plz Don't do this .",1
2.4 ghz is not working properly,3
As it says dual it suddenly drops signals ans re intiates it self.dual igms not working,3
dont buy even network is good this no internet light will on for every 2 or 3 hours and disconnect from the network totally trash please dont waste your money on this router,1
"Don't buy this product, frequent disconnections. Better to gonwith other brand. I called to tplink customer care but not getting response.",1
Not compatible with Actfibernet. Frequent signal drops.... Replaced once.... 2nd time returned it and got Netgear..... TP-Link did not work for me,2
"wifi signal is really not good and 1st floor only its not coming and its really bad signal, i wish i have the option to not go with this next time",1
Router is very good but it buffers when you watch something on TV,2
Don't buy it. Its working like 700/- rupees router.,1
"Needed support from the ISP tech team to install. Getting good speeds but despite opting for a model claiming coverage of a larger area, network drops in a 900 sq ft house.",3
"Opened box received .. looks like used wiring and lan cable..

It‚Äôs a used peice .. when I called service boy and customer care .. it‚Äôs used by some Mishra‚Äôs .. this is kind of service provided and products.. pathetic ..",1
Signal coverage is not great you will require WiFi range extenders but at this price point performance is ok,3
Not satisfied with the product. Gets heated very often. Disconnects every 15mins which is really irritating. What's more disgusting is Amazon is giving replacement instead of refund for this item üò†üò§üò°,1
wifi just doesnt work. frequent network drop. very disappointed.,1
"Wifi strength not good enough for area mentioned
However, 5G speed is good but have to be close to the router",3
"Waste of time and money. I get full signal only when I'm next to the router, signal drops off as I move away. My bed room 15feet away from the router I hardly get signal point and unable to use internet.",1
Range for 5G channel is very weak. Didn't get singal for 50 feet. 3G channel is okay. Video calls were dropping off.,2
If you are looking for signal strength do not go for this....not more than ac 1350 at half the price,1
"WiFi signals are too weak, loosing connection within 5 metered range. There is no return policy so in short lost 3k will have to use old router, waste of money.",1
5G band ended after 1 year of usage everything about this device is fine but the purpose of 5G comes with expire and then you left with 2G network only,3
Dlibk provides wider connectivity and pendrive connectivity option in almost same price!,3
Signal range very bad üëé,2
"Steer clear of this Router. After 20 days of usage, it started rebooting randomly. And I'm not getting any response from TP-Link support team.
ZERO stars deserved.",1
Worst Signal or I got a Defective Product. Other wise the toy looks good and easy to install.,3
"Wifi signals did not come up.... Due to late installation from isp in lockdown , amazon also refused to replace it.

Amazon didnt allowed replacement as well",1
range is poor.... i have home of 1434 sq ft. the signal doesnot reach all corners,3
Unstable connection. Pathetic customer support. Goes on and off every minute,1
Actual router look like A6 not same as showen in picture,3
"It's irritating to buy a tp link routers as they don't provide any service.
Range of this router is very poor I had to go stand next to it to get signal",1
"After a month now it has stopped working .
If you witch off and then in it works for 5 mins and then the light turns orange.
Now the return window is closed so I can‚Äôt return.",1
Does not have Wi-Fi repeater mode,1
Amazon website product photo and i received model products is different. I replaced but received same. Model no is correct but design of receive l model A6. It is confusion of us because price is different,3
Not working properly.. very bad. And I am not able to contact customer care also..,1
Doesnt have advanced features. Parental control is not working.. Only dual band for this cost is not acceptable. should have a decent firmware atleast.,1
Faulty product its not working properly and get through the costumer care is headache,1
"This router doesn't even cover 10 sq feet area properly. Although it allows 100mbps connection easily, there is no point of buying this one",1
The router was giving me a constant problem of dns failed on my ps4 while using my old n301 tenda got rid of the problem so i returned it,2
"Very much disappointed really no bandwidth control,even small router today are providing it's just the gimmick by mu-mimo name.Just an ordinary router nothing much",3
The router is bigger than my old dlink router but sometimes my ping get disconnected but the wired connection is ok.The wifi range is not as expected.,2
Range is not one strong point. Otherwise the router seemed to perform well. Just the issue with the range.,3
Lan speed is less than 20mbps and wifi 50mbps and in my very old Dlink is more than 50+mbps,1
The product was different than it was shown in the images.,1
"Easy to install but file transfer speed is below average, even in 5ghz mode it transfer files max 5 MBps",3
WIFI Power is quite poor,2
Wifi performance is good. However the original power adapter's circuit board was blown within a week. Reached warranty support and they mentioned physical damages are not covered.,2
Wifi keeps on switching from 2.4 to 5 ghz which causes distruption if you use vpn... Not a good product... Speed is same as other cheaper routers no improvement,2
Good product but technical support is very less and price is quite high compare to product,3
Good but not signal range,3
"Worst device, waste of money customer care not supported",1
I get only 75mbps while this says about 1000mbps..,1
Waste product. Don't buy this one. I am repenting. Wifi always disconnects with ! this mark. Don't buy at all.,1
WiFi signal is very fluctuating. Not stable. Can‚Äôt even cover 650 Sq feet area properly.,1
The 5g signal is not at all satisfactory.,3
"Gets hot after 1hr usage
Wifi router should be designed to run 24√ó7 without getting hot
Range is good but drops connection once it gets hot",1
Takes a lot of time to turn on completely...coverage is very limited,1
The range of Wi-Fi single is very small even when there is no wall/door in between,3
"I think I recieved a used router, it was just closed using tape , above scratch gaurd was having some scratches and I had to reset router in order to use it. I needed it badly so I didn't returned it.",1
Its range is very poor also no support for dd wrt firmware,3
"WiFi range is not that good. Not able cover a single floor, when kept at one side of the floor",3
WiFi signal is not that good as the company brags about. Rest all okay,3
The power adapter stopped working after 8 months of purchase.,3
"Very poor reception, buy and repent in leisure.",3
Disappointed because recieved a used product. Hoping it will not repeat again.,1
This is WiFi Repeater not range extender.i buy extender but this is a Repeater.,1
The Wifi Strength is strong. However the is constant problem of internet connection problem when the router starts,3
Absolutely pathetic product ! Dont go by the user ratings. Worked fine for few months and now after using for 8 months the wifi (2.4ghz) keeps disconnecting & upload speed drops to 260kbps at times !,1
"I got the product which did not work, It did not have a valid Ip, could not load a setup page, Tried to reset but it would not reset either.",1
Not getting full network in all rooms. Poor signal,1
"on the first floor, it's not getting the wifi signal height is 8 to 10 feet only.
on the same floor, it's ok but only in the same room when you move out it goes to 60 %",2
"The product listed is good, however with one category called version added to Amazon listing, saves money for both customer and Amazon.",2
"Technical support, in few weeks of my purchase ,router stopped working and when I called Amazon for replacement n service ,nobody is assisting me,horrible waste of money .",1
It didn‚Äôt help,3
Too much unsatisfied with the purchase. My old cheap mi wifi router gives better range than this. I can hardly connect to wifi router fron the 1st floor and no signal on 2nd floor.,1
"Worst product I have seen in my life , replacement is big problem and company not care about their customers, still my issue has not been solved after replacement",1
"Worked for 2 days then stopped.
If you buy this please remember to keep the box.",1
"I order a TP-Link Archer C6 Gigabit MU-MIMO router and started getting connectivity issues, now I checked the product s.no. it's a refurbished product and I paid for the original.",1
My router is not working ager three months . What should I do.,1
Worked good for three days. Stopped working after that. Restarting router takes 5-6 minutes. The UI is so overdone. Its slow and clunky.,2
This is not working and its only 10 days but due to festival i did not find time to replace this. What should i do now. Buying so much costly product but its not working.,1
I purchased the router so the wifi range would be extended throughout my house which is only 1000sft and unfortunately it did not do the purpose....Its a decent product but not an excellent one.,3
"TP link 999 product was my old router, this one is not even 10% of that product. Waste of money.",1
Not too good,3
No so worthy product‚Ä¶ most of the time connects only to 2.4Ghz and week signal even next to router‚Ä¶ slow buffering.. not at all happy with the product,2
"This is a very bad product, the wifi didn't even start after turning on the router. Several attempts were made but still the wifi signal doesn't show up at all.",1
Wifi range very bad,3
Not recommend to boy.,1
"One the first shipment the product was faulty. (It happens) Got it changed.
The second router that was send as replacement was used and unsealed.",2
If this had a 4G sim slot for this price point it would have been good.,3
Expensive compared to Mi device. Check Mi before you decide!,3
Product is not working. Amazon app not allowing to place return or replace request. Giving some crap errors. Pls replace the product at the earliest.,1
"I bought tp link archer c6 on may 12 and it is not working from June 2nd, as return window closed no tech support from amazon. not happy with the purchase...",1
"Worst converge ever. Basic D link router for 800rs covers more area than this router. Waste of money.
Been a big challenge since I installed this router.",1
"Wifi signal not in adequate range, I bought this for jio fiber. The coverage is not good and the speed also not upto the mark when connected. Completely dissatisfied",2
Wireless coverage is not good. Limited area coverage thoughts a new technology. My earlier without antenna router ( 10 year old product) had larger coverage than this.,3
"It gives lots of wifi signals problem, sadly forced me to buy other router.",3
It is okay product,3
Please don‚Äôt waste your money in buying this router. Even if u sit in front of this router you won‚Äôt get full signal in your device.. Never expected this from TPLINK.,1
Bought based on the hype. I don't know why I don't get the 5ghz band range in my bedroom 10ft away from the device,3
I bought it from Amazon sale. Worked well for initial few days and then stopped working. Could not even return it. Waste of money.,1
"Frequent disconnection, difficult to configure, hangs a lot you have to restart it again and again.
Go for tenda ac10 instead",1
Amazon has sent me a used router .. when i tried to connect router it showed me some one elses name,1
Product is unable to support multiple devices. Since last 2 months unable to utilise it. WIfi service provider has checked and other router are working fine,1
Worked fine till the Amazon return window and within 15 day the wan port is not working. This router does not have even repeater function.,1
WiFi doesn‚Äôt work . Money waste,1
"Product was good, working fine then suddenly it was just dead, had to follow with Tp link for replacement but it took 2 weeks for the same so no internet for 2 weeks",1
Signal fluctuations,3
poor,3
I have received 2 units. Both are not working. Waste of time.,1
This router is rebooting automatically again and again... Very annoying... Waste product... C6 seems to be having technical bug... Not recommended,1
I am not able to install .. customer service is very worst..they hardly speak never picks the call,2
i connected Wd passport 1 TB to it..but it gets restarted again and again ..nor does it reads....what can be done in this case my hard drive work perfectly fine ..i connected pendrive it shows..but the hard drive does not show up..any solution to it..,2
Signal drops n also every 30 min internet gets disconnected... worst,1
Not at all satisfied with the range it covers ... very disappointing,2
The range of Wifi is not good. It works well in my 180 SqFt room but just outside the room the signal strength becomes weak. A little farther away the signal strength is not usable.,3
"Item is not working, After plugging in the light of the item is not on or blinking,
Do not know how to return, since the guarantee is for three years",1
"Wifi Signal is not coming from living room to bed room which is 7 ft away. I was quite disappointed seeing this because, it was mentioned that range would be up to 2 kms",3
Poor quality .. waste of money. Need Refund,1
"I thought this Wi-Fi will be good but I was wrong,if we mention about problems in Comment Box then what is the use,TP link router you need to Recognize the problems and solve it as soon as possible.",2
The wifi signal is not as described... might be a fake one... As the speed in the 2.4ghz band is poor... Not like original mentioned...,1
"It develops fault within 1 month and no Service from TPLINK. Replacement still pending till today.

Bad product and very bad service",1
It is not working from 1st day ... no wifi signal ..only power light is shown . I'm trying to contact TP-Link support team but no positive response from them ...,1
"Not getting enough signal strength, maxinum for one bhk around 500 sq feet, open area 10-15 meters nothing more, kept in the shelf now.
Total waste of money",1
"Router design was good, simple and easy interface like other Tp-Link Archer's, This router has VPN issue, it cannot show list of connected PPTP VPN clients list.",2
WiFi speed drops gradually. After restart it improves. Previously had Cisco which never gave this kind of issues,2
Ok,2
"Pathetic! Does not works with Mi TV at all
Increased signal range is only good when it's on paper
It's not worth a plastic from which it is made from.",1
Wifi signal is not so good for a Duplex house,3
Have been using it for 4 months. Signal disconnects repeatedly. Have to then disconnect the cable and reconnect it to get the signal back on.,3
Defective product. Caught fire resulting in the switch board and multiple devices and nearby furniture catching fire. Minimal support from Amazon support team.,1
Device Stopped working only within 15 days. I was doing my regular work on my computer and the machine just stopped working suddenly. Had to cancel all my work. Dissapointed.,1
Doesn't work properly with phones,1
The range of the signals is pretty bad. 2.4 ghz drops from 100 to 20-30 Mbps within 20 feet.,1
Got the product delivered in this state. Seems to be a used one repackaged and delivered. I'm returning the same.,1
"WiFi connection drops intermittently and even signal strength is vey week , this router doesn‚Äôt seems to be good for high speed broadband connection",1
Power Adapter may be fake. I m unable to scan the barcode and there is no sign of Tp link.,1
This is a very poor product for the price. The internet connection is very inconsistent and drops out very frequently. Totally frustrating and disappointing.,1
"First month of use is very good but after usage of 1 month wifi signal is not coming and also reset button also not working
Unable to reach tech support",1
Signal range is not good,3
The 2G is really bad and won‚Äôt even cross 40 Mbps in speed. 5G network is good.not worth the money,1
Completely stopped working after 5 months of use. It's dead. Don't know about warranty etc.,1
Everything is okay but the main purpose of using a router doesn't meet the expectation that is Range. Range is very short it doesn't cover my 1500sqft two storey building. TPLink could have done it better at this price.,1
"The unit after 2 weeks of installation started misbehaving it would drop speed to 35 Kbps fromm1.5mbps

Have to get it replaced",2
Not at all happy it says the range is good but it is not the case a much cheaper product then this gives better out put,3
"NO LAN cable, No USB cable, moreover the router was having minor scratches came within an unsealed box most probably a used one",1
Troublesome. You have to switch off and on regularly.,2
The gadget appears to be a good one.,3
"After complaining, they gave a refurbished model and still has some issues.",1
Used product with scratches and preloaded settings was delivered.,1
The signal is good and installation is easy. The router keeps restarting itself once in a while. This is very frustrating as it throws you out of calls.,2
DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. YOU WILL DEFINITELY REGRET. WE HAVE BEEN HAVING FREQUENT DISCONNECT ISSUES AND UNABLE TO WORK CONTINUOUSLY FOR NOT EVEN 1 HOUR.,1
Literally the most harrowing experience ever. The router signal keeps dying periodically and requires atleast 5 reboots a day. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend at all,1
Very bad.. every time connectivity will drop down..reached out to customer care for more than 15 times with 3 months but no resolution,1
I bought this product thinking range will be better than cheap router but there is no difference in range it has the same range as other 2.4ghz router.,2
There is no battery need usb power.,3
It's not working properly. I want to exchange my TP link archer C6 AC1200. Kindly exchange my product because it's mentioned 2 years warranty.,1
"worst product by tp link, you can't use it as extended router or connect it with mobile wifi hotspot. Be careful if you are looking to buy it.",1
I have received the open item and inside that the bill date and recipient for another address from which it might have been returned,1
"Better to purchase other products, found break in signals freequntly.",2
Very bad product. After 2 months it stopped working. Service center experience is very bad too. Currently the status is that it's of no use to me. Not working.,1
Poor durability,2
Useless product don‚Äôt have wireless repeater function money waste,1
Came with open packaging. Product working fine so far.,3
"Product is ok but range is nothing great compared, I was just taken by claims made ,u might get better product at similar cost",3
"Very worest product,Its not cover 600 sft ,flat area. Don't buy.",1
WiFi signal not reachable in the next room though it has 4 antennas and placed in an appropriate position not at all happy,2
"Honestly speaking I purchased this router to have a better signal, it fluctuates like anything, expected better than this.",1
"Wifi range good range and the speed is also good
But the time taken for restart is dead slow and connecting to the wifi after restart also slow",3
I had ordered this product and then realised this wouldn‚Äôt work without a modem. I had raised request for return but no one ever came to pick it up.,1
Not heappy with singnal sometimes singnal drope in the same room and dose not even covers 1st floor device is on ground floor,2
"Signal strength is not great, had a basic wifi router prior to this which had better signal strength than this one. Quite disappointed with this buy",3
Initial Setup was simple. Speed decent. But the Range is not good ... Covers very small area in a realistic apartment layout having concrete walls.,3
Most hopeless purchase,1
This product stopped working in less than one month. Power is not passing through adapter. Lights switch on for few seconds and then it gets auto switch off in few seconds. 1 star is basic to write so I gave 1 start.,1
"The product is not good as well as range is not covered
Try to return the product but no one has responded",2
5G Signal range is very low. 2G range is also pathetic without a repeater.,3
"Keep losing signals
I thought the problem with net work
It does not maintain connection with host IPN
Every day Wi fi doesn‚Äôt work",1
This does not work with BSNL FTTH fiber,2
"this is not qualcomm chipset. Beware of buying it, if you are buying it as a QCA product. Then dont go for it.",1

"I have got second hand router, wi fi name was singh but not the default one. Also I have ordered fresh one but got exchange pick up with no Bill.",1
Don't buy this.. This is a worst product..,1
"Router not receiving internet connection , I have configured the settings still not able access internet.
I'm still using my OLD 2.5ghz router",1
It barely works. Exchanged twice and still waiting for pick up! Nonsense fake stuff!,2
This is not an 802.11ac router. See attached photo. Wrong information on the amazon site.,2
"Power connector is not acceptable, router end pin gets plugged out of it's own as it's not sturdy. OEM need to look into it seriously",1
Stopped working within a day. Not even powering on now,1
I have a 100MBPS connection.. but the speed on the router is not that great. Also.. the onboarding and set-up process can be improved and made more user friendly.,3
"3rd class product. Weak signal.
Purchased 8 months ago",1
Got a damaged product,1
Damage product after 6 months not working,1
As per picture it is A6 model but received C6 model,1
Wi-Fi signal is bad my previous router is iball 300n is better signal of this router,2
"The router does not work at all and it gets rebooted again and again.
Is there a chance to replace it in the warranty?",1
The modem is not working not connecting . Want to replace.please help as it's my hard earned money..,1
Wifi does not work if router is rebooted. Router needs to be factory reset every time when power goes . Signal strength is not inconsistent.,2
A good product...not able to get proper network on my samsung tv from my children's bedroom to livinh room,3
Worst defect peice tried to use and did every thing waste product,1

"The router stopped after 3 months , but even after 9 months there is no replacement on product even though it is under warranty .",1
"The worst part of this router is the frequent signal drops. If you leave the lap top idle for 5 min, the signal drops. Have to reconnect each time",3
Overall its performance is good but the green led light is not visible but my previous one is blue which is good,3
Returned.,1
good but not a great range as expected and written in reviews all over,3
Doesn't live up to the expectation... Wi-Fi signal is not that strong...mi was better as compared....i loved tp link dual antenna router,3
My expectation was ruined...such a horrible router. Internet gets disconnected very frequently and signal strength is very weak,1
I paid Rs.7500/- just to Stop receiving Internet connectivity within 3 months. Good for no use.,1
easy to install,3
Waste product not even work for 1month also,1

The range is very low. I do not get normal and 5G signals even in the adjacent room. Also get disconnected everyday.,1
The speeds on this router are as expected. However it lacks in range. You can get a full signal beyond 1 single wall.,3
It's a defective piece I am totally disappointed,1
Received empty box. It only had a cable,1
Terribly disappointed with the range. My 7 year old Belkin was actually performing at equal footing. I wanted to upgrade for range and was very disappointed.,2

Network issue,1
Tplink is brand and they should maintain there goodwill in market but this device not up to the mark.,1
Doesn‚Äôt come with warranty !!! I purchased it in feb 20 & it stopped working in may 20.,2
Please make the replacement process simpler. A costly device such as this should have a better hardware life.,1

This is a Chinese item. Cheap body. Don't buy.,1
Too many things not mentioned here about the router ... waste of money,1
Expected better coverage. Multiple features but going about is not that user friendly,3
"within 6 months router stopped working.please advise how to replace it.

"HP Printer is very good, no doubt and a buy at the price. The only problem is the ""loss-leader pricing"" of the replacement cartridges which become uneconomical in the long run...",3
"I won't recommend this. Hardly it worked, it's not at all taking papers for print. Waste of money.",1
"Printer catridge 805 not available anywhere including hp store, without catridge the printer is idle no use.please don't cheat people like this.If the product has no support from its manufacturer please don't list it.",1
"Waste of money. Because I had printed around 75 pages with black and white,by that time ink is totally completed. And i didn't find 805 ink cartridges anywhere. Till now .......",1
"HP All-In-One Printer price is very attractive but running cost of ink cartridges is very high.
Scanning is good quality but can scan only one page at a time & you need a separate file binder software to merge all files in single document.

Now coming to cost- (discounts can be available occasionally)
Printer HP 2131 costs close to Rs 2,300 (under discount offers)
It uses HP 803 Ink cartridge.
B/w cartridge costs Rs 702 & colour cartridge costs Rs 836

B/w cartridge can print around 60 pages for Rs 702 & colour cartridge can print max 40 pages for Rs 836
thus cost of single print is Rs 11 Rs/page (B/W) & 21Rs/Page (Clr)

HP's claims for number of pages are under economy mode & under lab test conditions - actual user will get above stated numbers
refill kits are available at half prices of original cartridges but quality of colour prints will be compromised.

Thus recommended to purchase only for occasional users with low usage.
Not cost effective for regular & heavy users.

Please also check my review for HP Deskjet 2135 for cost per print

You can encourage me to write further reviews by hitting YES button :)",3
"A very bad product. I can't imagine HP is selling such a part printer wherein the cost of one print out is almost 10 bucks. The ink cartridges are not even able to print 100 pages and cost of cartridge is 1000 bucks so it's cheaper to get print out from the shop then buy this piece of junk.
We even went to the HP store to sort out this but they have no clue. ( Or sometime ignorance is bliss)",1
"Fantastic delivery by Amazon. BUT STRANGE, was not in normal Amazon packaging???
USB cable faulty, careful study shows a duplicate as no ceramic finish, plus pins are not in line.
Installation is done by me using old cable, printer working fine no problems there.
WHY IS IT NOT POSSIBLE TO EXCHANGE CABLE ONLY? don't want to return whole product waste time, and had disposed of the original packing.
Strongly recomend anyone, not to accept product if not in amazon packing, think this was my problem.however was in hp packing and sealed, but who knows who is responsible? all i need is a cable, price on amazon approx 1500, printer cost approx 3000. ""crazy""",2
"Worst printer. Just to check, gave a print for 50 black and white pages. The original cartridge got over. Original 805 model B&W cartridge would cost you around 800/-. Which means one black and white print will cost you 16/-. U can go to a photo shop and get a print on canvas at this price. Worst printer. I regret as there is no return only replacement. Please don't get cheated.",1
"Good decent printer. But difficult to find replacement cartridges. Made huge mistake by buying this printer. If you doubt me, check in Amazon for HP 805 cartridge. Even HP website don't have them. I can't even return the printer. When cartridge dries up, I can't buy original cartridges. May be have the printer as show piece.",2
"waste of the money to buy this printer, the link will just dry within 2 weeks if you are not using it, the new cartridge cost is very high , you buy 2 cartridge at the same cost of printer, the cost of printer ink is more then human blood. better use your own blood for printing it will be much cheaper",1
"Per page is too costly approx 16 to 40 Rupees per page do not recommend for home

Its better print the pages from outside market.

Also shared in the Facebook and recommend my friends and colleagues do not purchase this printers .",1
"Defective product, not able to print a single page. Carriage struck in the sides of the printer loudly. Now I have to contact HP service. Very painful process",1
"Don't ever buy this printer...instead go for ink tank ones...although this one is cheaper the ink cartridges will cost you the same amount in which u can buy a new printer again... not worthy from such a big brand HP...they made the printer price less but kept cartridge price the highest among all of its range...simply fooling customers..
even cannot use any other cartridge and refilling was also complex.. sometimes works sometimes not :(",1
"I got a second hand product the product was opened and on side the barcodes were torn and then everything was just rapped with a tape

I always thought when I read review that ""it would not happen to me I will get a good product""

but here we are

Also the main box was opened and over it there was a plastic tape put to show as if it was original seal u can make out with just the packing

The product looked as of the person has been using it and he soled it

Plz think about this when u buy this product",1
"Cartridge is very expensive....not recommended to buy this product .Not Cost effective at all ,Priniting from local shop will be cheaper than printing at home",1
Very poor product replacement needed immediately..no parts available & it‚Äôs a very of so let product,1
"Bought this printer on 19.08.20.After printing perfectly almost 10/12 pages , it is not working. Customer care suggests to visit a nearby service centre. If this is the after sales service, then I would definitely never ever opt to buy an headache with a handful of money.",1
"I sincerely regret purchasing this product. .there is a major flaw in design it self. Only from one side paper support is there in the tray. So there is no proper ""driven in "" for paper into the printer. It is drawn into the printer from unsupported side it goes on an angle. So print comes as spoiled. I talk to Amazon person they told only replacement is there for this printer ,no money back(may be because HP aware about the flaw in design) , they connect to HP support they told they will arrange a technician that day itself, but no one come for service until now(3 days). I don't know why a reputed company like HP is selling these type of products of no use & keeping their after sales support very bad. When you purchase a printer from HP ,please think twice",1
"Cartridges are very very very little life...

I am thinking to make the video..

"Changing my review from good to bad. Because in just 7 months the printer started showing problems . Claiming warranty takes forever which FYI means a customer support executive to just hear your complain with nothing done in real.. The ink leaks . Printer throws out blank papers even after and keeps on automatically restarting. It doesn't even recognize new cartridge. Pathetic printer. DO NOT BUY IT IF ITS FOR DAILY USE. BECAUSE ONCE IT STOPS WORKING IT IS GOING TO SPOIL YOUR DAY, EVERYDAY",1
Printer cost is low but ink cartridge cost is too high.,3
"This product is a scam because it‚Äôs ink consumption is very high and demands constant change in cartridge and this results in excess expense. I have used this printer for hardly 2 weeks and I have changed the ink cartridge twice already (max 20-25 pages printed)

Please don‚Äôt get tempered towards the product because of its brand and cheaper price. I hope my reviews helps both the seller and the buyer in their respective ways!!

P.S - I look for the seller to contact me and compensate for this fault product.",1
"Product is good for the budget. Unable to get the specified 805 ink cartridges in any online sites including Hp store.
Printer is ideal now without the relevant cartridges.",3
There is No ink available for the product i have been sitting without ink from past 1 week wat is the use of buying such product,1
"I got this one primarily for scanning the old photos and save them in PC. It does it's job. Nothing to complain about scanner. About the printing, good for few prints but really this is not a heavy duty printer. For serious printing and printing too many papers, go for some higher version or a laser jet. This printer is just for scanning and printing few papers and not for heavy use.
Print quality: good but not for heavy use
Scan: Good and it does it's job.
Durability: not that good for heavy printing, good for scanning. Body of the maching is not that heavy and not that sturdy.
Installing: very easy to install, nothing special engineering really needed.",3
"I purchased this product in 2017 during Amazon sale. This printer is very easy to use and very friendly but cartridge is the biggest issue. With the company provided catrdige, you would be able to hardly print 15 to 20 sheets. If you do not use the printer even for 2-3 days, the ink will dry and you will have to replace the cartridge.

Each catridge would cost approx 1000 and you would be able to print max 90 pages and each page print would approximately cost you 11 Rupees, which is very bad.

I sold this in OLX for 1.5k and brought a ink based printer from Epson for 6.5K. This printer prints 6000 sheets for a catridge worth 500. The cost of each color print would be approximately 18 Paise.

Think well before you buy this printer.",1
"Not that much of good quality printer it is, I have order two printers instead of one, unfortunately it was happened by amazon's recommendation options for sure. The tech team and the seller should take care of this feature when its availing to any of customer its getting automatically adding two quantity in the cart section, I was usually do double check but I missed to confirming this time. My bad! Amazon tech team is also not ready to help me out. They saying that as per our policy is not allowing us! I'll tell one thing Amazon team! ""Policies are only made for product not for humans' tech activity mistake!""",2
"Guys, if you see the tag bestseller and are buying it please research first. It is very tough to use never gets connected easily. 1st time it worked well and then it never ever worked seamlessly, it always had an issue of connection or ink etc. As soon as i used, it got over in hardly 40 pages and i thought something might be the issue, however second time the same thing happened third time again .. i called hp people and they told me it is only good for some occasional printing ...like 1 or 2 page occasionally. If someone buys printer it is sure that one would never print a page or 2. I am extremely displeased with the product as i believed in hp products... so if you have to print 1 or 2 pages you can go for and then also 1000 bucks for 40 pages is the worst investment you'll ever do...",1
Nice,3
"One of the worst purchase i have ever got from amazon..reasons to justify are as below.
1)First of all the outer box is not completely sealed..
2)printer is not a brand new one,its a product returned by someone..we can clearly see the invoice of others..
3)both the ink catridges are missing from this peice.
How can someone dispatch an used item and more over without even seeing wether box has all the products.
Terrific customer experience.",1
"I was using an HP 1515 all-in-one printer for several years but it got stuck with a paper jam problem. It did not have any setup cartridges, but this 2331 printer is having them. Instead of simplifying setup, HP is making it more and more complicated. Since the setup cartridges are to be thrown out after a 5-minute use, they only serve the purpose of eco-unfriendliness. I can manage with this 2331 because I am running a one-man business.",1
"After 3 days of purchasing the color printing not working properly and only the pink color is print on paper.

For solving this issues i called to HP customer support but i only roam on the website and shows number is invalid

Still if the company read my review kindly contact me.",1
"Giving review after 3 months view..

Never ever in ur life ,even if by mistake dont think about buying this inkjet or deskjet type printers of Hp.Hp is chinese.and we know china and chinamall.
I dont know about ink tank printers but yes this type of inkjet is a total waste of ur money and time.

My hp 2131 printer lasted around 3 months only with so many messy things ,
Printed 40 pictures with the demo catridges.
Next 300 pages with refilled ink of good quality.
Now both of color and black catrige doesnt recognizing.

New Catridges cost 1900 around. That is insane amount compared to printer cost.
Hp suggests always replace catridges after single use(40 photo printing-1900rupees).they wont even listen or attempt to repair if there is other faults otherthan catridge unless u buy new catridges of 1900.

Then why the hell will someone buy this costly catridge rather not throwing the machine in first place.we do not have money thats why we came to this cheap price.

You may try inktankbut again that is also fitted with so many chip components and i doubt hp set some type of firmware there too,but laserjet is defimately best option for a cost effective and long run printer.
so at the end i am going with CANON LB2900 as it is long lasting and made from Japan.
Previously i have a canon inkjet ip1300 .that has been working for 10years .trust me.
So Canon is a good choice.hp may have more service centers than canon,but what if u cant get the service out of that.
Nothing is more than costomer satisfaction.

So u may try canon inkjets.but i personally recommend always go for canon specially laser printers.",1
"It's low cost printer but maintenance (running cost) is too high. Printing cost is approx Rs. 8-10 per page for Black and white and Rs. 10-12 for color printing because cartridge will cost you Rs. 700 (B&W) and 850 for color.
Or, If you are thinking you will refill your cartridge then you can't, because HP Smart app will deduct that cartridge and you can't print with that you have to purchase new cartridge after printing 50-60 Pages.
Hope It will Help you to select right printer for your need.",1
I purchased this 6 months ago. I purchased it for my personal use at home. But I did a big mistake. The reason not to buy are : -1.paper get stuck: - first few month it was smooth experience but after that whenever I wanted print the paper gets stucked in the middle of the printer. Then I have to manually remove page from printer.2. Unpleasant noise : - printer makes a unpleasant noise while printing. It gives feeling that the printer has been damaged. First time I was scared by this noise.3. Poor quality of print : - the quality of print is not at all good. This is a ink printer.4. Costly cartilage : - they are must expensive black cost 800 and colour cost 1000.then don't work even 1 month properly.Note : - don't buy this printer.you should buy the new generations printer this is very costly and not effective.BELIEVE ME.,2
"If you know how to remove a few pieces of sticky tape and follow pictorial illustrations to slot in the ink cartridges, the initial setup is easy. What is not so easy is getting HP's Smart App to work. It's an utterly senseless interface with ambiguous prompts and instructions. Once you have figured out that you don't need to 'add' the already installed printer, then you run into a regularly freezing app. Thank goodness for Ctrl-Alt-Del. HP offers no advice or good solutions for their Smart App's freezing problem. There is a workaround though, which I finally discovered after trying umpteen number of things. Terrible terrible 'Not-Smart' app. Print quality is OK. Scan quality is poor.",3
"Printer is budget product for home use, but original ink is a big scam, 2 Rs. manufacturing cost of product has MRP Rs. 754/-. And local ink refill will not work every time, Sometimes cartridge will failed, some time printer will block the cartridge. and indicator light will blink continuously. Reset and other tricks available in youtube will not work once cartridge blocked.",1
"Defective product. After installation almost I have wasted my 2 hours with HP team for getting my problem resolution of paper not loading.. and they have assigned an engineer for resolution of the same ...

25-Jan-2021: As per HP care Team product is faulty and needs to be replaced.
27-Jan-2021: Replacement product received. Which is also faulty and now a refund is initiated.

In case you want to waste you 1 week for this long process go ahead and purchase this trouble box.",1
"It is simply impossible to understand as to why HP cannot create a simple installation system. You have to first download an app which then refuses to recognise the printer and keeps asking to ""connect"" the printer when it is already connected! In three days after delivery, I have somehow managed to install the printer on two laptops and still waiting for HP app to work on one more laptop. All in all, utterly third grade product. I had canon printer earlier which was fast easier to install and operate. Not surprisingly, HP has named its printer driver as ""HP Smart"" - it is the dumbest app around",1
Horrible horrible when it comes to cartridge. Printing is good quality only if you install orginal original cartridge if you try to refill the cartridge with different ink things was really messy each cartridge cost 750 rupees so you can understand how expensive the cartridges are. it gives only max to max 100 page of good printing.,1
"Please read till end , trust me please don't buy this , after one cartridge is empty if 164 prints are done from one cartridge it will show empty cartridge and one cartridge costs 1200 and if you use this printer so rarely the ink will dry up or if you refill an empty cartridge it will not print anything and buying new cartridge everytime it drains up it will cost you 2400 per month , it's better to buy a expensive printer rather than buying a cheap hp one and later knowing we were scamed it and even now you are not convinced than try printing some images of 2K and above it will print them near to 720 p there's no reason to buy this awful thing",1
"I think it's a stupidest buy of my life.

I got this Printer at 2400/- odd, I was very happy but soon I got to know about this fraud.

Printer they are selling at 2400/- and guess what it's cartridge is worth rs. 1500 /-(If you are buying Colour Cartridge as well).

The maximum pages 50 it has given. Till now I have brought 4 cartridges worth rs. more than 4k which more than cost of this printer.

It can only be successfully used as a Scanner.

Be smart and research about what I am saying.

These cartridge wont last even 1 month.",2
"It's ink is very expensive, when you're a regular user and daily you need lots of pages to print, it's not at all cost effective.
One time cartridge prints only 100-120 pages or even less and you've to buy new cartridge worth ‚Çπ900(approx) .
For 100 pages-‚Çπ900??
Is that worthy??
Not at all
Please don't buy this and opt for sustainable options on which you can rely upon in future.
Hope it helps.",1
"Honestly speaking I buyed this product as it was best selling product ... After a day use, its cartridge goes empty and I ordered ink worth of 500 to fill this ... And after filling it also goes to empty after 60 pages and after filling again it was not doing the printing so I have to order a new cartridge worth 717 and then after 60 pages it again goes to empty and the printer is not doing well and taking out only empty pages ..... Totally waste of money .... I prefer not to buy this .....",1
"If actually U count. It comes to 6-8 Rs/print on one side only.
Plus the cartridge though they say it prints 180 pages/cartridge. Mine works only for 100 max even without pictures/diagrams which might be considered uses more ink.....
Only advantage is i can print whenever i want. Whatever i want. Apart from that, its a waste...... Though product works great.....",1
Within a week it's paper jam issue started. Hp technical person saying nonsense things. It printed only 20 page. N he saying yes sir it's only 20 page giving cartridge is empty. After we bought new cartridge again it strucked now he's saying it's not cover in warranty. I purchased this just 15 days back it completely waste of money and time. Hp is worst support. I do not recommend this product don't buy this brand it's just a brand u can't get any support.,1
"Printer is good, no complaint but cost of printing makes us cry(i put least quality prints). While buying we think we dont take much prints but that opinion does not last long. Go for ink tank even if budget does not permit.",3
"If you are looking for a cheap printer for home use, for school work, hobbies etc, and you print about 50-80 pages per month, this is the best one available in the market for that. All in one printer in less than Rs 3000 is a steal indeed. Very easy to set up, just download the drivers from hp website before hand.
Color print at draft setting comes put with lines , so keep that in mind.",3
"Did not work well, could print only 5 black and white pages and stopped printing after that. Color prints were also not good from day 1 itself. Need to take it to nearest HP shop now to check whats the issue. Updating the review again .... in total in printed 78 pages only, after this HP forcing to buy new cartridge for 800 which will print 100 pages,,, so per page print cost is 8 on top of money paid to buy the printer... third class useless product",1
"Don't Buy Only 90 Black&White Pages can print with one cartridge.
I was take wrong decision to select this printer.
When you going to purchase new cartridge it's cost is 700 to 800 rs.
You can't refill cartridge
Don't believe on YouTube video I tried many times but it's not working.
I suggest to HP plz low down cartridge price .
Now one Print cost using with this printer is about 10 to 12 rs for Black & White.
Any one want to buy this printer plz read my review carefully and also watch YouTube review",1
"so I gave all rate 3 stars but I gave
print quality 5 stars
Easy to install 4 stars
Easy to use 5 stars
BUT
the printer costs 3,299
with cartage
and after like 20-25 prints the black&white cartage is over & now throw that cartage in the garbage and but a new 800 rupees cartage.
same with the colour cartage but the change is colour cartage costs 1200 rupees",3
"Hp ink catridges are 750rs for black and 999 for tricolor, black ink gives merely 150 pages then u have to buy a new one,if anyhow u try to refill it ,catridge gets distorted then never be of use again and if refilled properly print quality is always smudgy and sometimes unreadable",1
"Never buy cheap printers. This is totally a scan big printer giants sell printers for small amount of money. Because their main agenda is to sell ink cartridges and that where they earn money from.

This is the cheapest junk you can buy. It stopped working after 6 months and got repaired in warranty, then again it stopped working after 13 months and now HP is asking 5000 rupees to repair it. Plus it is a ink guzzler printer one cartridge barely prints 70 black page. And 30-40 coloured prints max out.",1
"The printer is not useful unless you going to print 5 or 10 pages a month
Pros-
Print quality is good
Easy to install
Cons-
The ink is very expensive , the first time we have printer around 30 or 40 pages then we had to buy a black ink catridge which is around 750
When printing in bulk it does not print the pages correctly, eg if I give page 15 to 20, it prints some random pages like13, 17 and all
Paper feeding mechanism is not that good, you may have to keep adjusting it",2
"The ink hardly lasts 30 pages , specially the back cartridge.
Combined Ink refill cost is more than printer and they are hardly available.
Initially thought this is worst HP product ever in terms for value for money then concluded all printer companies are scam.",1
This is a one of great scam....the printer is less expensive ....but the cartridge are tooooo expensive....and slowly you get habitual with print....and you want more and more categories....and now the cartridge are not available in the market....owned and controlled by company,1
"The print quality is okay but the real problem lies in the catridge after 30 prints it showed low ink when we try to take the diagnostic pages it gives clear print but then u can't give a print frm ur pc and u can't take a copy as well regret the purchase, so I am updating after use and I replaced the catridges and the printer is still not working go for other companies the repair guy also hasn't arrived even after complaining to the company",1
 Not worth it I paid more than 3000/- for it installation was not easy for a begginer or first timer. Print quality not that good average. Print cost is very high as just by printing 8 colour print catrage is empty. Pathetic will for sure return.,1
"Very delicate. Parts break easily. The inkjet provided says 120 papers of printing, it finishes in 40-45 paper.
Avoid.",2
"1st week of July 21, I have purchased this product for my domestic purpose , Hardly taken around 10 printouts , From 15/07/21 printer not working, I have contacted HP Service center they assured within 48 hours issue will be resolved , but no one turned from HP , on 17/07/21 my complaint was closed by HP without resolving the issue , in the meantime return window with AMAZON was closed , then I wrote several mails but as on date printer in repair condition , Feeling depressed. It's like scam . I don't know what to do now. Friends think twice before go with HP products . They making us fool.",1
It seems the black ink cartridge was already dried up .Few prints were taken and the impressions were very light and then it stopped altogether.Now I am getting my print work done from market.The colour cartridge dose not print black & white work at all.There is some problem. I did have two copies printed of my vaccination certificate with colour where in PM‚Äôs photo was in colour.No technical staff ever responded my call. The printer is lying like a monument.If approved I would like to return it and buy some other model or else cartridges be replaced and also technical assistance provided to ascertain serviceability of the printer.,2
"The product I received that is the printer, was not sealed (I am saying that the printer is not sealed not the packaging ), the thermocol packaging inside the box is broken into pieces, there were no ink cartages, there is no manual or any quick start guide, there was no software cd or DVD, the printer is not taped also. It was definitely either a defective or a used product. The seller should make sure about the quality of the product. I have purchased a lot of products from amazon and this happened to me for the first time. It is really disappointing and it will create a bad impression on the seller.",1
"I have always used HP product and have been satisfied with the service as well as the products. The printer is not printing only after 40 days of purchase. Paper is getting jammed and nothing is printing. tried the basic self help from HP website. Still the paper is getting jammed. I need to contact HP for service and support, I do not have much time for the run around with the service center, tried calling the service center they are not picking the call. I don't know if I am calling the right number. The rating is purely for the product.",1
"If u have enough money and no mens to use that money then buy it, and waste all ur money by spending on the costly ink-catridge. If you try to refill it with other ink ur catridge will get damage someday. So my suggestion is not to buy it. I should research on it before buying it. Anyway it's now a decorating item in my room since I can't afford that costly ink-catridge.",3
"Print quality 8/10
Installation 10/10
Using 10/10

Now I found the reason why hp is buying this good printer for low price, if you want to print pictures this is just a scam. If you want to print a pictures it prints just 4-5 page & cost of cartridge is 1200 so cost per page is 300 rupees, when I bought this printer & printed 4 pictures on A4 size pages and my ink got over I thought you I don't used cartridge and I ordered for new one & after installing new one I printed again A4 size picture & checked cartridge it because half.
HP don't even allow us to refill if we refill our cartridge then our printer will not have warranty so if you are only black and white printer then buy then one but for colour printing don't buy this better go to cyber cafe and print what you want or buy laser printer never ever buy inkjet printers for colour printing.",2
"Things I want you to know:
1.It is not cost effective for long term.

Reason: The cartridges which they give (1 Black and white, 1 Tri-Colour) are not at all sufficient. At max, you will get 50 best quality printouts or 70 Draft/Normal printouts .

2. You need to buy extra cartridges which will print around 190 pages and will cost Rs.755/- per cartridge. Just keep this point in your mind.
3. In my case, the same day, the printer arrived, after printing 5 pages, all the lights started blinking and I had to lock a complaint call to HP. The technician came after 2 days , applied white grease , dealt with the cartridge placements and repaired the (new) printer!
4. You must take the extended warranty for at least 2years, coz you shouldnt rely solely on the guaranteed product.
5. The print quality will vary according to cartridges. But I must say, go for the wifi enabled printers [which it isnt].",2
I bought this product from amazon. after install I found out that its driver is not available on HP site. I tried to refund but amazon customer agent didnt allow and pushed me to install HP Smart and told that it will work with that. BUt it didnt work. Now amazon is saying that refund window is closed and I can not return this useless product. I dont know where to reach it to refund or get it working....,1
"Packaging os very poor, look like box was opened from downside and also inner box is tored on handle",2
"If you have a Mac with OS after Catalina, it is impossible to install as the Mac does not recognise it. My new HP DeskjJet is now a piece of furniture !! The manufactures should be take to task for not clearing stating the this printer is not compatible with Mac Laptops.",1
"since I bought this product printer not working, we hardly printing 5-10 pages ina day, since day one which is not working, we using our next-door printer ( we thought its some drive issue - yesterday I have so IT person came and look into this, he said this mechanic is gone not able to fix ........ what is the guarantee of this product we simply purchase from amazon --I don't know whether your people checking this product is working are not ???---- I am not happy at all i need refund and take back this -even if there is no money return also take this and throw this crap to his face........... i dont wank keep this e waste with me ....",1
"I now understand why it‚Äôs priced so low. The description sells you quality but starting from installation, the paper tray and it‚Äôs alignment to the quality of print - it‚Äôs as cheap as the price. I would recommend future buyers, to at least see the quality of print, before you buy this product. After comparing the print from a cannon printer, I feel a bit short changed.",1
"Printer is ok for those who are economically well to face heavy maintenance cost. I could print only 80 pages (b/w) with the provided cartridge. I realised that it is not meant for me, so i returned it immediately.

Pros
1. Comparatively cheap cost printer with AIO features
2. Good printing speed with medium quality for home purpose
3. Quality scanning and functioning

Cons
1. Heavy maintenance cost (especially for cartridges, you have to pay about Rs. 769/- per cartridge)
2. Colour fades after few days
3. Colour print is not up to the mark
4. Ink refilling is an option but risky (lasts maximum 3 times per cartridge)

Suggestion
1. Better go for ink tank printers, even though initial cost is more - profitable in long run (if you print atleast 300 pages per month, then compulsorily go for ink tank)
2. Take care in case you plan to refill the ink, it may damage your printer as well as void your warranty",3
"Print quality is good. The ink that comes with the printer is demo one, good for around 25 bw and around12 color pages. After that, the new ink cartridges are costly. Almost 12 rupees per bw and 20 rupees per color sheet. If you use it frequently to do not go for this.",3
"Don't buy this product you will regret in future.
Although it's price is 3500-3700 but it will cost you 8000-9000 in future.
After printing only 50-60 page the cartridge will be empty and you will have to buy new one as it is not refillable.
Cost of new cartridge is between 650-800.
So after every few days you will require new cartridge.
And there is only one cartridge of color (not three for the three colors).
So atlast after changing cartridge once you will regret your decision.",1
This is not for the Latest Mac OS. For Windows it is ok. Before buying it recommend you to check the available drivers for the OS you are using as this seems to be an old model from HP and even Apple was not supporting,3
"Please don't buy this printer seeing the cost. The cartridges finished super fast and absolutely does not work if you try to refill it back. The cartridge is of course qay expensive. We already had a hp printer but after a while you obviously don't get the cartridge (ploy to sell new models understood). Got this one for OCCASIONAL printing, but now having a bad headache coz of it. Less than a star.",1
Usng it is very costly the cartrigde ends very soon and then when you want to buy a new one it's about half the price of printer.! cartridge prints not more than 40 pages My printer After the 2 cartridges which were included with it got over i could not dare to buy new one because of its price and so i threw my printer,1
"this printer received as faulty; xerox & scan functionality never worked.
contacted amazon for return straightaway; but as it's under warranty of HP, the only way is to contact HP to fix it.
HP engineer came up and detected faulty scanner head and promised to replace it soon; now it's more than 2 months and still waiting it to be fixed.
disappointed, AVOID !",1
"Print quality is ok.. Not good for printing on smooth surfaces because ink does not dry. Not good for printing on both side u need to change paper manually. Color cartage gets over in 50 pages black and white in 65 print speed is slow 3 color paper per minute 5 back and white per minute. Scan takes 5 minutes.. But the thing is every function works it is all in one printer
If u refill it with fake turbo inks the printer finds it and the printer software shows there is no ink.. But it can print..",3

Absolutely worthless product. Within 15 days the product started malfunctioning. Worst part is the ink. It runs maximum 100 pages in a single cartridge. Paper jam is another problem. Nothing is good about this printer. Why even #Hp manufactures such product which wear outs within a week or two. It is not even worth 1000/- rupees. It is absolute junk piece in the name of printer.,1
"Bought this for my kid who will have to print a lot of notes. Other than the looks , nothing is what it seems. Fragile to handle.The back-end support is not stable.It takes the precision of a surgeon to main the paper in the exact position so as to be picked up my the roller to print. Print speed is too slow. If you want to print 50 pages or so , dedicate half day of yours for that. Waste of time and money. Returning it in the first 3 hours.",1
Not even got 40 copies with given black cartridge. Problem within 4 weeks of purchase.

"Product seems average. Was given a product by the seller where the seal was broken , installation CD was missing. I tried to place a replacement request but instead I am asked to contact HP for missing accessories. Isn't it the basic requirement to provide an untampered product by the seller ?",1

I was bale to take only one clor phpto print on a phot paper .After printing a single photo the Color Ink indicator is blinking was therafter not able to take a single print.

Bought hp deskjet printer a month back. Recently i am unable to take black and white print. Contacted hp service online & then informed my print problem to HP service executive. In turn they advised me to contact local service centre of hp for replacement. Surprisingly HP service centre denied any replacement of cartridge as it‚Äôs setup cartridge. HP seller has not informed that printer will be delivered with setup cartridge (limited print capability) and we have to by normal cartridge additionally. It‚Äôs unethical & not expected from hp,1
"After 3 months of usage , an writing this review , sometime the pages we print are not printed in correct manner on A4 papper , sometimes the alignment is not correct while printed in A4 , and some time a small portion is sliced off at bottom or edges while printing.

As per my opinion the said product is directly imported from China and keep in ware house no PDI/No checking done and also not inserted the user manual in Indian language or English language. and deliver to Indian customers,1
Don't Buy cartridge printers. It will cost you much much higher in long run after 2 to 3 years if you compare between (both cartridge-printer + all the cartridge you have purchased) and (inktank-printer + all ink) you will find out ink tank is much cheaper . Better go for inktank. Never think you can refill and use old cartridge HP blocks old cartridge after it's ink get empty. Printer will not detect refilled cartridge.,1
Print quality is very bad as the black cartriage slot not printing properly and only coluor printing slot work. Installation is very hard as the i was applied engineer for installation after 6 hours long time printer installed and not easy to use as the cartriage daily empty.,1
Print quality is very good but scan quality is not upto the mark... installation is not at all user friendly they need to give driver oftware CD....if you are not computers savy you will then face the heat while installing this printer,3
"This is a simple, old school, wired printer for light, basic use. Haven't had it long, so can't comment on print yield, etc but it is straightforward to set up, *as long as you are using it with Windows devices"". HP customer service is pathetic and humans there are incredibly difficult to access... I will not be buying HP again.",3
"I have received the product and looks nice. I tried to install the device but there are lots of issues. Mainly driver is not getting installed. After that I have contacted customer support team to assist for the installation and it got installed.

Not sure why I am having this issue, If i am trying to print multiple document it is not possible. After the first file got completed need to restart the printer to print the next pages.

Any one know how to fix it?",2
"Looks good , prints well but there is a big problem in the way it pulls in the paper. Mostly paper doesn't get pulled in one go and one has to repeatedly push and keep pressing the feed button. For heavy users, this may get really frustrating and also compromise the life of buttons. Didn't expect such substandard quality from HP.",3
"The printer is working perfectly fine and the quality of the print is really awesome the only drawback of this printer is the cost of the cartridge. The combo of HP 803 costs around Rs 1500 which is half the price of the printer itself. Moreover, the cartridge does not last long for 100 pages the maximum pages which can be printed with a single cartridge is 20 pages.

I would recommend not to buy this product unless and until you wanna spend your hard-earned money lavishly.",3
"It's actually will be more economic for you to go to your neighborhood photocopy shop than using this printer.
650 rs per cartridge wont even last 100 A4 pages in standard quality.
Inkjets are such a ripoff, man.",2
I printed aound 30 copies and the ink was over. Hp printer app dint work for me to get print outs from my phone. I had to download Nokko printer app on my phone. Not at all satisfied with this product. Please go for a better printer. Don't be decieved by the price. Not worth it.,1
On installation of printer and software. A test page and alignment page printed. Checked estimates ink level in cartridge in the HO software. It showed 2/3rd level in colour and nearly 1/2 level in black. Either cartridges were faulty or with low ink level. Black cartridge printed no more than 50 pages. Most expensive per page printing cost at around Rs 15 per page.,1
"Overall Printer is okay for home use.
printer catridge is liitle bit clogged while printing. ink level is very less.
also, no carry/cover pouch is given inside the box for keep safe from dust.",3
"From day1 we had issue with this printer as one of the print cartridge (color) did not work at all. Despite follow up with the manufacturer, even they were not able to fix the issue. Now after using it for a couple of days for just black and white printing, even that print cartridge also stopped working. Overall very bad experience with this printer and service. Not recommended to buy.",1
It's not value for money after you buy as usual any inkjet ...after you use some day after 2 or 3 refilling you get lots of issues al always ...eventually its cheap but maintenance of the printer not so low,3
Good product but only issue is that cartridges are too small and hold very less ink even on refilling. Cost of new cartridge is too high. Economy printer should have reasonably priced cartridges.,3
"The print cartridges aren't proper. The ink consumption is very high and per cartridge cost is 720 bucks. Colour cartridge supplied alongwith the printer doesn't work. I need to now go to HP service center to get a resolution to a newly bought printer.

Dissatisfied as a customer.",1
I received my printer today. The Cartridges package was open. I am not able to take color print. Black Ink Printer was of poor quality. Awaiting response from Amazon or Seller on replacement or refund.,1
"I have purchase this product but the printer has not printed 50 pages , and showing problem with printer. Also my product is under warranty but still I am not getting any support on this item. It is not printing any document. Is it possible to exchange the items ? Worst item received from Amazon . No quality check and after sales services .",1
"I like everything in this printer but the real reason is about disliking this product is not imtge printer but it's cartage system it's very much costly you could even buy a new printer if you wish to buy two three sets of new cartage don't buy this printer if you wish to print economically don't take this printer even you if you want to print 1 or 2 prints because that will even cost you more than 10 or 11 rupees per print so don't buy by another type of printer which do not use cartridge system if you want to print economically

Press the helpful button if this review was helpful for you",2
"Don't buy if you want to use with apple laptop. It's smart sacn software won't detect in Apple laptop and won't allow to print.

Printing cost is too high.
I had only printed around 40-50 black and white pages with black cartridge and it is empty",1
"DO NOT BUY HP PRINTERS.. They do not have driver /Software for Macbook IOS version 10.15.5 .. on several request n calls HP customer care replies with a sorry saying they do not have driver for Mac latest version so i have to wait until they have it. Amazon customer service said they will refund they money n pick the order (I have a confirmation
mail from amazon) which they have not initiated till now.",1
"One of the worst printer to date that I‚Äôve used. It‚Äôs just a nightmare to print using this. Even if printing 2 pages is like a task. Pages are getting waste and the biggest mistake that I did was I did not process it for return. Now I have to either throw it or give it someone at whatever they pay for, I would definitely not recommend this product to any one.",1
It does not print black. I tried all online resources but failed. Don't know what is wrong. Color ink is ok. Black is full but not giving output.,1
"It's jst 4 months that we buyed the product and it is not working.... It was fine till we were using the 1st cartage but after replacing it with a new one it stopped working...
It would be bst if you buy a gud printer spending some 8000 coz it would prove to be useful in long run and the cartage would be less expensive also.. the cartage with this printer is very expensive costing some 1500 for both colour and black&white and 1 cartage hardly print 100-150 pages so we have to change it time to time and it would dry up if we are not using it regularly so total waste of money. It is just wise to buy some gud printer with less price for cartage.‚ò∫Ô∏è",1
"After printing around 26 pages of A4 size the black ink got empty and the colour ink indicated low. No colour print had been done. Very disappointing.
The cost of ink is too high .
Please see that it doesn't happen to another customer again.",1
It worked for 15 days now doesnt read the page and no matter what keeps giving you error. since didnt use it much so had to call HP for service. I have bought this in January 2021 and used it for a few months as it has limited usage in my home.,1
"While installing the printer,it's showing that the black and white cartridge needs a replacement .
Even before printing I have to replace the cartridge.pathetic.",1
"Totally a scamüëé... They keep the price very low just to seek the attention of the customer s.Cartridge price -700 and u can only print 120 pages from that Cartridge ...
Rather than this buy laser printer...",1
"If anyone wishes to buy this, please note that the cartridges are too expensive and you'll only print around 100 pages from each one of them. Go for the more economical versions of HP printers, whose cartridges are cheaper than this.",3
Some times the printer dint work. While some times it misprinted. But i would say it's ok. The most disappointing thing is ink which is very expensive. U can go for it but i will suggest look for some other brands. Small review after months of use. Not good for intense use.,3
"Printer ink cartredge is not good, Black colour is getting over very soon and need to refill the ink often.. And technical support is not good at all.. And black cartredge is not working Properly unable to take prints.. HP technical people are telling to buy new cartredge even though my printer is under warrenty and totally Disatisfied with HP product.",1
"The black cartridge had worn out soon. Other cheap inks are not much of a use. If not used daily, concussion will form in the cartridge. Much bigger job. Atlast you'll be using this printer only for scanning. You can buy a cheap scanner for it. Why buy this waste package of expensive commodity which will pressure you to buy more and more HP cartridges and Ink again and again?",1
"I have purchased it about 6 months ago mainly for scanning, but not satisfied with scanner quality. Its scans blue ink signature as black and violet color stamp also not as violet as actual is, in other words its scan does not give true colors. Also, its printing consumes more color inks, which resulted in expensive printing costs.",2
"Unable to install and unable to get any support from Hp as the site goes on asking only questions and the product has no installation cd nor there is any support from the designated site they provide
Thinking of returning the product",1

"Buy this item after considering the following point, because the printing cost is very high. If we insert a new cartridge cost around Rs. 800/-, just 100 Nos of A4 size paper can be printed. Moreover refilled cartridge is not accepting this system. So consider this before buying ink jet printer..",1
After installing printer in October 2019 it worked only for one month with 802 black cartridge. Once it got finished bought HP 803 cartridge which was recommended by HP. It did not work. Followed HP instructions to sort out matter. Did not work. Then bought HP 802 cartridge because it had come with original printer. That too did not work. Since last 45 days attempted up teen times to contact helpline no. 18002000047. You just do not get it. Orange light continuously blinks. Have no idea what to do.,1
Its Very Easy To Use.. and its worth buying but the problem is its ink costs about ‚Çπ700 for 100-150 pages.Good product but not so good... iF you are buying then please look for its ink too... Its only available in amazonüòÇ,3
"Very bad experience, i m ordered new printer but i received already used one, 2nd hand, box already opened, and without catriage like colour and black both are misssing",1
"I am prime member but i received damaged, used ,old product. Black and color cartridges & usb cable are also missing. Very disappointed üò†üò†üò†üò£",1

"Not so worth buying this printer, print quality is good, but the cartridge of this printer is very small and as they say on website that the cartridge can print 165 pages, it's just to fool the people for buying the product, actually the print is only of 45 pages only. This is same with black as well with colour cartridge. The prices of the cartridge is rs. 1400 to buy. Sorry to say this printer had failed because of the print cartridges only.",1
West of money dont buy this product worst product this froud cheater online purchase amazon specification distils 100 page print per cartridges but 25 page printing next empty cartridges so friends pliz dont buy this product and online purchase who responsible repairs small small problems go the service shop no response shop workers so üôèüôèüôèüôèüôè,1

"Can use it as a showcase peice.
Prints only 10-20 colour pages and prints approximately 20 b&w papers.Then u r done with printing.
If u want to purchase new catridge it would cost around 2000.
You can purchase new printer again and use it as a showcase peice.",1
"Printer received without any damage. And it's working properly. Black cartridge with printer is not working, totally disappointed with the seller.",2
It's a good printer for the price only drawback is the paper feeder is on top paper doesn't remain stiff and gets folded so a bit disappointed with that,3
"Didn‚Äôt like the packaging and the product seems like used one.

Delivered cartridges/ refill delivered are used one (Empty)",1
"I don't recommend. My personal experience, it will cost you more than taking print out in some browsing centre. Because only high end printers gives more printout for single caridge full. This machine, if you replace carridges / fill it, for 800 rupees, it can produce 60 to 70...print out.. Which will cost outside 350 rupees..",2
"Didn't get the CD to install, so I visited the HP Website and followed the instructions. I don't prefer to buy this again as the cost of cartridge is high. The print quality is somewhat okay, but not satisfied with the scanner. The automatic ""beautification"" will push me into trouble. Hope to get an ink tank printer.",1
"I purchased this product from amazon on dec 7 2019, and hardly used this product. The cartridge ran out on 5th June 2020. When called the support they said that this printer has been used for 4000 prints and 3 cartridges have been changed, I have been given an old and used printer and old cartridges. I suggest do not buy printers or electronic stuff online they give refurbished items.",1
They sell you these printers super cheap to rope you in. Each cartridge costs 900 now. That's daylight robbery. I should have just gone to my neighbour shop to get stuff printed. If u are a heavy or medium user don't buy this. Scanner is good.,1
"Did now like the printer at all , its damn slow , i feel i just wasted my money , and as i delayed in testing it by a couple of days from exchange period , they did not consider it for return as well,
Now its just a useless box , Scans are fine , but totally not worth",1
Such a waste product. You must keep using it regularly otherwise ink will get dry and the printing head will never work even after replacing with new cartridge. Suitable for regular usage people only.,1
The printer drivers don‚Äôt work with Mac so don‚Äôt buy it if you plan to use it with Mac,1
Cartridge refill is not allowed and the cost of new Cartridge is 800 rupees which is not affordable for every 100 or less than 100 pages total waste of investment,1
"Dont buy, Basically i dont write review but took sometime to do it becoz catridge prints only 100 paper and cost of catridge is too high, u can travel 15 km to take printout in that cost",1
The printer has stopped working...even though the black cartridge is not finished but the printed has stopped working...I got this printer on 29th june....its been only few days its performance is not good...,3
Good but for some time this 803 cartridge was not available for some time recently I purchased 803 cartridge not yet stars usage,3
"They will rob you in the name of buying other cartridge when it's out of ink. It doesn't accept refilled catridges. You can do nothing but be forced to buy catridges from the company. Once you buy catridges, it will be the same price as or next to a new printer.",1
"1) first of all it is not 2131 series it is 2130 series
2) prints only 50 pages of black& white and 35-40 of color
3) cartridges are very costly ( both b&w and color )
4) you will have to only use compatible cardridges i.e only HP cartridge compulsory
5) no refill, no print.
so according to my experience waste of money with useless restrictions.",1
Sorry to say but it's a waste of money... I bought this printer for my home use believe me it gave me 15 pages only then I bought colour and blank cartridge of HP 803 and gave me 19 pages only of colour and now the black cartridge light is blinking continuesly and no one to help me I am like struggling with this waste product... Amazon should not incaurage such product... I want my money back for this... Hope amazon will help me...,1
Cartridge very costly and no longer life. Very low count printouts. Scanner only used. Cartridge not available in market easily.,1
Every time I try to install the printer the software says stopped working. I am really frustrated. To add to it the return is stopped on 1st August. I just want to know what I can do. Can I get some help from your local support in Goa? I would prefer an answer please.,1
"this product was not good,,i used only one week then the catridge failed,, and the print was not in good quality,,,i really dislike this item ...pls re take the product i dont need money,, pls re take ur product. and once advice dont sell this type of printers and dont spoil the amazon name",1
It's not 2331 product it's 2330 model number now in may this printer broke down just lasted 5 month don't buy this product,1
"This item is a HP Printer which is totally slow for printing a paper.. color or black & white both. And I haven't expected performance like that. Very bad
I want to return this item..
But u haven't show option for return this item",1
HP 2131 All-in-one printer purchased from Amazon on May 2020. Seller is Appario Retail Private limited. Product is now non-operational. Discovered that the warranty service has already expired as on October 2017! This means Amazon is promoting sale of old outdated products! I want replacement to new printer immediately!,1
I request every one to read the reviews and than buy any product.....I liked most of the things in it except for the cartridge system it's been only few weeks (2 weeks) since we have bought.....We haven't printed any thing except for 2 or 3 prints the cartridge got finished..... If this is gonna happen after every 1 week then ths our loss we cant keep on buying the cartridge every nxt day.....Hope they'll work on this tooo.....,1
"Worst printer, in terms of cartridge usage. Each cartridge costs not less than 750/- and prints only 50-60 pages(black). If you print color picture it will give only 8-9 color pages printout.",1
Please dont buy this printer the ink cannot be refilled. Each time new catridge should be used wich cost around 700. Go for a printer where the ink can be manually refilled that is more economic than such kind of printers.,2
In clear words DO NOT BUY this printer because of cartridge you need to refill it after after every around 30 pages print and after refilling twice you have to chnage the cartridge. Regretting after 6 months. Go for laser printer. Because in long term you will see laser will be cost effective than inkjet.,1
If u are ready to pay 12 rs per paper then buy this printer.So expensive to maintain this.Catridges are so expensive.we are buying almost 2 cartridges per month that menas we are spending 1600 per month only for catridges.,1
this product is for one time use. Once the cartridge finishes it will become wastage of money as it will not work after that. Even i refill the cartridge it doesn't work. Then I ordered a new cartridge even after that this printer is not working.,1
"Idiots they didnt give me installation CD
Then I installed from net.This model no driver is also not available I had installed another model no which is working somewhat in my printer.",3
"This is a very good printer for home, but soon you realize it's too expensive and not viable. My cartridge was over in less than 80 pages and black n white cartridge would cost more than rs 800. For me this is just a box now, I cant afford rs10 per page.",2
It is not easy to use....better not to buy from Amazon as the return is not possible in the dissatisfied case....Duplex printing s not possible. Print quality s very poor.Not even 50 pages printed ink got over.Not budget friendly,1
"Cartirage cost is very expensive around 800 , only 50 to 60 page overall print by this printer , i prefer Epson printer with tank , under rs 5000 ink jet printer is wastege of money. dont buy this very disappointing result. baaki apki icha hai , i dont recommend this printer .",1
Pathetic product from hp. The print quality Is absolutely bad. It hangs up again and again it does not give print at a time. After one print it stops printing and the customer service is also pathetic and bad I have tell them to give a demo but they not listen our problem i tell them to send a technician they said we can fix it from here how is this possible. So I am giving one star for this printer,1
"Printer is good but i prefer don't use deskjet printer, both cartridge cost is Rs.2000+ and you can only print maximum 100 Pages in B&W and 20-30 Pages in Color.
Its a very costly deal for me...
Looking forward to a laser printer...",3
"The HP Deskjet 2131 printer is really good. But when it comes to cartridges (HP 803), it is found to be too costly. The printer costs a little over Rs3200 whereas the cartridges cost over Rs1700. Considering that a set of cartridges produce hardly 100-110 quality prints (HP claims 1000 pages, but I never got), this printer is not cost-effective overall.",2
"This a really bad product.HP has just made this printer to show that they are making the cheapest printer or productüò≠üò≠but its cost comes to be very high bcoz the cartridge are costly and has to be changed every mnth.Pls do not buy this ,this just a waste of money.they are not even returning now i want to return the product.ü§í",1
"As you can see print quality is very bad
Never buy totally waste of money . If you want to buy buy laser printer it is very bad and also delivery is very late even copy quality is bad never buy this if want to buy printer then laser printer. Laser printers are very good also use can use for long days",1
"It's good. Packing was good. But it's very difficult to connect with macbook air.
You can't connect automatically. Need software's.

Really headache to use in macbook air but easy using in windows laptops.
And print quality is very bad.",2
"It's printing quality is good but everytime there is a lot of problem while reusing it.
When I go to the service center of HP when there is some problem there is no response and I have to get it repaired outside in market while it is in guarantee period of 4 years",2
Print quality is very bad...use and throw cartridge which very expensive to buy and also it gets over very soon..doesn't even get back the money of cartridge.. waste of Money,1
"I could not yet got the feed back from Amazon as I want to return it. This is defective product -Incompatible Color cartridge. Contacted HP help as advised. Hp is telling they require every details of trouble shooting so that they may be able to give some suggestions , Horrible experience. Just 05 days back the material has reached, I don't know what to do . It is lying on my table just as Junk.",1
I do not like printer. Actually i order for HP deskjet 2131 but seller send me HP 2130. It is hopeless printer. I advice don't buy this product. Only 25 copies I print. And black cartridge ink become empty.,1
The ink is really expensive and only prints 120 pages being a frequest user its worthless to buy this nd instead visit the photocopy shop which will be at cheaper cost.,1
"The product stopped working after two times use. Tried my best, it's showing 'Device Error' and stopped printing. Do not buy this HP printer.",1
I have not been able to download the drivers as the HP printer drivers are very user unfriendly. HP gives a wizard which is not allowing me to get and install the drivers of this printer. Can someone help me please on this,3
not a super printer. does the job. Print cost is high. Especially not good for photo printing.,3
Sometimes it doesnt print and it forces us to print a test page. The ink got over within 20 prints. It is rip off. Save some more money and buy a different brand.,1
"Extremely small ink cartridges. After every few pages, the cartridges run dry. Also, my 10 years old Epson printer has better print quality than this printer.",1
Dont buy any printer online in Amazon as after sometimes if you approach to manufacturer for some problem than they will inform you that product is not in warranty and his warranty is expired even before your buying date. These are selling you an out of warranty product.,1
"Color cartridge received is damaged one and printer led blink whenever this cartridge is put inside the slot. On browsing the HP website I have found that this product warranty has expired before it was delivered to me. It is shocking how can you sell product whose warranty has already expired around 2 years back.
Stop making fool of customer and replace this product immediately.",2
Affordable printer easy setup but the cartridge enclosed with it did not even give 50 sheets of printing both black and colour printouts,3
Dont buy pls cheating,1
"It look smart printer but,it did not set to ur laptop through given commands, we order given item is HP 2131 printer there shown in laptop printer models HP 2130.tell me how it shown this like? Otherwise you send old model item. Pls clarify it as early as possible.",3
In the midst of printing suddenly it stopped. Colour and Black Cartridge lights started blinking. I bought a new Black cartridge and installed it. But wit the result that there was no printing as the light on the black cartridge started blinking.,2
Purchase after 10 day light blinking problem and i am so many time try to check the and refrefl and change the ink cartridges but this problem not slover it.. My suggestion is all printer buyers never purchase the hp deskjet 2131 printeramd print out and photo copy cost also hight to onther printer üñ®,1
"delivery was pretty good.
printer is good, print quality is much better.
single paper struck inside printer, not holding a single paper.
can print every type of paper.
but cartridge problem.
after filling my colour cartridge 4 to 5 times its showing that cartridge is not working.",3
Pathetic printer...seller gave a used printer,1
Amazon cheated me. I purchased this product on 7th May 2019. It has a warranty period of 1year. Recently i observed that printing quality is becoming very poor. So decided to contact HP costomer care for repair. When I checked the warranty period i got terribly shocked because it's warranty period has already expired on September 2019. Right now i just don't know what to do.,1
Bought this in January this year. Within 3 months it started giving trouble. Incomplete printing jobs. Discoloration. N the service agent came to check and said both b&w and color cartridges are dry! In less than 7 months!!!! Horrible purchase.,1
"The pice of a new printer is very low, but the cartridges will make you cry. Two small cartridges both colour & black costs half the printer price and wont even last 30 prints.",2
"Print quality is very nice , however printing time is more as printing is very slow, cartridge ink level is also very less considering the high cost of cartridges. scanning quality is also pretty good.
Overall a decent printer.",3
"It is sooo slow at such level that if you want to print a copy from laptop to printer,in just 1sheet it take aroung 1 min....yeah speed is descent in scanning but in printing from mobile or laptop it is terrible",3
"Cartridges are more costly compared to printers... Once you buy this printer, then after 150 pages you have to buy a cartridge and the starting price of a cartridge is 1800/-.
From my perspective, you have to buy a printer with an ink tank which is better than this printer.",2
"Use less got problem show error every where on computer on cartridges ,. Totally waste of money.....never buy cartridge printer /instead buy ink tank printers ,,,",1

The ink is finished so soon and catridge very expensive. Never buy printer from HP. They offer the printer with good price and ink cartridges very VERY expensive,1
"Poor cartridge quality. Does NOT print after 8-10 prints, although the app shows more than 70% ink. Appears that ink dries out in storage of 2-3 months. Not worth buying new cartridge around 1K every time.",1

"If you think you need a reason to spend money unnecessarily for fun, go for it. Otherwise whoever recommends this product are LIARS.

"Its like keeping an elephant as a pet.
Everything is fine, but cartridges will clean your pockets. Not recommended at all.",1
Easy to install easy to use but after ink is over in cartridge means we want to buy another printer or another cartridge waste of our money.no printing is coming if we fill ink in cartridge. I buy two printers waste of money.,1
Worst quality product. Didn‚Äôt have usb and power cable so i had to use from my old printer. The print quality was also bad as the printer couldn‚Äôt print anything. I had the old printer and used for many years and thought to buy in similar range but was disappointed,1
"User guide not found in the package, will someone come to install the product. Two (02) years extended warranty was taken and paid for, no warranty card found. Bill is torn, some portion of the bill missing and the bill is NOT readable at all",1
"The printer is behaving erratically, always missing pages while printing. Moreover, odd & even printing also always missing pages and it is never happening. Can I get service support for this issue from HP? Please help.",1
Don't buy this printer. I ordered printer on july 2020. It was working good till sept 2020. After that it stopped working properly. Very bad experience because ink cartriedge also not available online offline. No service centre available. So i request not to buy this product.,1
Quality is ok. Expensive as you can not refill the cartridge. Every time you have to spend Rs 800 fot B&w 100 prints.,2
"THE PRINTER IS UNABLE TO PRINT.I HAVE HARDLY TAKEN ANY COPIES AND NOW ONLY PART OF A PAGE WILL BE PRINTED.WANT THE SAME TO BE INSPECTED AND REPAIRED AT SITE URGENTLY OR U MAY TAKE BACK THE SAME ASAP SINCE IT IS HINDERING MY BUSINESS

"it was not printing even, I was trying all the customer numbers of HP but no number was working and I have registered online complain also but no reply.

it wasted my 4 days, in downloading software, installing, uninstalling but nothing worked out.",2
good quality in printing but the ink will be over after printing of 40 to 50 pages only. maintenance is time taking process and more money have to spent for additional tool kit.,3
"Worst printer ever for those who need to print even a dozen pages a day.
Go for some other printers in that case.
For those who print once in a while, should buy. Everyone else should avoid it otherwise.",1
The main problem with this prinyer is the cost of cartridge which is very very expensive. Not recommended at all. Very disappointed.,1
"Good printer. Cartridge cost will be too expensive.
You can checkout ink tank printer.
Inktank printer is good choice.",2
"The internal packing was broken and since I was short of time, I was not able to report it back. I've read similar issues reported by other users.

The scan quality is very very bad.

Installation CD was missing and it took me a while to find the desired drivers online.

Sorry but I won't recommend this product.",2
"The cartridge is too costly to maintain. Once the ink is finished, we can't refill the cartridge with the ink. Even if we try to fill the cartridge with the ink, the pages turn out to be blank or void of the respective color. Hence, the cartridge has to be replaced again, which makes it very costly to maintain.",3
I generally don't write review but this time have to and it's like the worst experience. Thought it's cost friendly while buying it but once ink finishes it's just useless box on table. I also don't understand why tiny inkbox cost is Rs.1700.,1
very bad and costly product it could print only 40 pages in one cartridge and new cartridge costs 700 Rs so printing becomes costlier,1
"not good at all.. always facing a problem to fetch papers.. i bought this in April 2019, since October 2019 it is not fetching papers any more...and this printer consume ink so much either black & white or colour print",3
"INK catridge out of stock, I have enquired online and near by shop, nowhere 803 black ink catridge available. So printer is not in use. it was not a good decision to buy this printer. I should have gone for some other brand.",1
Faulty cartridge..only 15 pages were printed and cartridge ran out..it takes several minutes for a single page to come out..,1
"There was no technician attending to my problem even after e-mailing them. Also asked for replacing the cartridges, which till today did not materialize. The printer hardware has 1 year warranty along with software media warranty of 90 days. The product was purchased in January, 2020. Can you HELP ?",3
Can't print using a mac. Making this quite redundant.,1
"Once the cartridge coming with the printer drains out, it will be too costly to buy new cartridges(more than 1000rs). The cartridges come along with the printer lost only for 150 prints (100 back and white and 50 color)",3
"I fitted ink tank to this printer externally, since catridge is expensive.",3
This one not best for budget. Catridges are finished within one month. After refilling cartridges are not working.,1
" Worst product ever..
Plzz don't buy this..
Ink cartridge not recognised after some use..
HP makes people fool by selling cheap cost printers and selling high cost ink cartridge.",1
"Tried connecting it with 4 laptops and just failed to take one print. Everytime I try installing a drive it says not
Compatible with this laptop. I tried it with Mac, linux and a windows laptop too.",1
The worst product gave ever seen. Pl. Do not waste money on this product. Probably the 16th century priduct this is. The cartridge will not even last for 10-15 prints. I am now trying to return it...not sure if i can do it. HORRIBLE PRODUCT,1
I don't recommend buying this printer.v It's ink cartridges are small capacity and expensive. Initially supplied cartridge printed barely 27 pages. This printer may look cheap but operating cost is very high.,1
"Printing does not stop even if the ink runs out.
Scanning and copying cannot be done without a computer.
I want you to improve.",2
This printer gives problems with pulling the paper just a week after the purchase and now needs me to push each paper all the way - very dissatisfied with the purchase,1
"Product doesn‚Äôt work at all with Macbook so don‚Äôt buy if you are using Macbook. HP support guys also don‚Äôt have any idea, so please don‚Äôt buy and get headache",1
"Not at all user friendly..ink gets used up so quickly. New ink is so expensive. Does not print photos on photo paper, it always give printer jam error for photo printing. Worst experience",1
Don't buy this printer. I purchased HP 2130 about a year ago. Now the printer got damaged with warranty period. But HP didn't respond my mail. I asked every offline store for service but didn't get proper solution. Another problem is the cartage dried out if you don't print for 1 month!,1
First time receiving something in worst quality. I received a used product. It was fully dierty and also the ink was fully spilled over. Two cadridge was kept with the box which was opened and used.,1
"Model no mentiond 2331 but on papper information mentioned 2300 DeskJet

Useless machine.. stops printing within month and thought may be Inc issue.. fillled Inc again and again.. still prints blnk pages.. worthless machine.. totally disappointed..,1
I really cant connect the item through my laptop trying since yesterday it will be great if some body comes over so that they can run this printer on my laptop or else i have to refund it.,1
The Printer is good for only single use means for one hour after that when the colour sinks it is a dammn scrap.. who the hell manufactured it i dont understand you cannot refill it if you do so it will so an error of your cartridge has been damaged and the cartridge price bulshit thousandfive hundred,1
"I hardly printed 10-15 pages and it says replace cartridge.. don't buy printer if you don't use once in a day. Called customer care, they said the catridge need to be replaced.",1
It was meant for sparing use at home. Still one can not expect such bad product.,1
"While I could use this easily, I am really disappointed with the cartridge, I have hardly printed 50 pages and in those 50 I would have printed 10 to 12 color print outs. And now it is not printing at all...",3
"Easy to install. You will have to manually look for the steps on google if you change your computer.
The catridge just comes up with capacity to print 20 or 25 prints. Thats a dud.",1
Not that great print. I would recommend buyers to get a better printer. It is very costly in terms of print per page and the ink also get dry to quickly.,3
No star completely useless no one comes to install I could get some one after four days one day it worked when we took sample to see if it works after three four days tried it did not work tried to call company did not get any response no one picked up phone doesn't have clue how to get replaced or repaired please help!!!!,1
"I purchased this product a month ago, only printed couple of pages . This product had stopped working only after one month . I am very disappointed by company . Please tell me procedure for complaint registration.",1
The black & white cartridge did not even print 35 pages. Company promises 100 prints per cartridge and sells one cartridge for almost ‚Çπ600. Roughly ‚Çπ20 per page.,1
Its been hardly 15 days and the printer is giving issue. The cartridge is having ink but no print is coming. Now since the window for return is closed. Cannot return the product also. Please don't buy this instead go for Epson.,1
Printer is priced low however the ink didn‚Äôt last for more than 8 - 10 prints. Had to get it refilled and serviced. Not of great use for people who want to it for major use,3
"1. Very bad paper feed and paper sensor. Two pages get wasted before I get a good copy of one page. 2. If multiple pages are kept in paper feed tray, printing doesn‚Äôt happen and jam or half printing happens. 3. Print quality is very poor.",1
I still couldn't use product is defective. Ask HP guy to come and fix it as I spent more then 1000 rupees getting tech guys to come and fix it used to work for I will pay for Hp guys to for or give me a call 9820902408,1

"Print quality is ok, but ink consumption is more. Wired installation is good but it doesn't connect wirelessly so be careful if you are buying for wireless. Difficult to use scanner, not friendly at all.",2
Never buy stopped working after one month. I am Amazon prime user but never got such bad product,1
The most important thing about the ink... very lower capacity than the written one... hope need to change it frequently.. worthless for the price,1
It‚Äôs worst product after 2 -3 page printing it is not working just waste of money .. plz don‚Äôt buy it ..and customer care also not supporting ..,1
No installation cd along with this printer. After all I Downloaded driver software from hp's official website. But it is not easy to install.,1
This product is very very worst. It took 5 to 8 mins for 1 black and white printout also it too more tha 15 mins for color print. Pls don't by this and don't waste your money... invest on premium printer..,2
Printer is good but the price of cartridges is immensely high and cost of print per page is therefore high.,1

Worst product...not able to set up n print..its 2nd case by appario company...initially they given used jbl headphones and now faulty printer.. guys don buy through appario,1
Dont even think of buying this product. It will only last for a day and is waste of money. Ink is hard to refill and ink overflows. Too much work and not worth it,1
The printer comes with a single black cartridge. After only 20-25 prints the cartridge went low on ink and stopped printing. I suggest not to waste money on this product. 20-25 prints and again purchase cartridge. Full waste of money.,1
Pathetic quality. After three use only the printer stopped working.,1

"I had been using this printer for last one year, while the printer is good the cost per page is too high. One black or color cartridge can only print 30 to 35 odd page and the cost for both is rs.1500. So this is not worth the cost....",1
"I bought this printer in 2200 rs. I was very happy..
So i bought ink bottle(100ml 100 rs proline) in advance for refilling cartridge .
After empty the cartridge, I refill it with this ink.
But printer is blinking and show empty ink.
I taje print out..but it is blank without any text...

Then i read the status in ink cartridge that..."" FOR SINGLE USE ONLY"". See the given pic...

Now, new cartridge purchase karne ja raha hu... Dekho kya hota hai...",1
"NEVER EVER buy this printer. I got it at a ""sale"" price of 2500/- I think, don't remember exactly, didn't take many prints, but the cartridges got emptied. Now when I am trying to buy the cartridges from an HP dealer, the price of black and color cartridges together works out to more than 2100/-. I have never felt so cheated in my life.",1
"This is a terrible tragedy. Do not buy these cheap products. My item was delivered on 09 Jan 18. Used it occasionally. Today I tried to print but it only returned blank pages. Only some color texts/designs are seen. I ask Amazon/HP to replace it immediately regardless of the time that has elasped, for promoting/selling a useless item. I expect immediate response from Amazon or HP.",1
Very bad quality stopped working after two time us . Bought warranty also but they are saying we need to go to HP authorised dealer . What a hassle .,1
"I am writing this review after 1 year, bought in July 2017 to meet my occasional prints need, was very much happy that I'm getting printer in very less price around 2500 which has, color, normal printing and scanning option would be great to have this, and finally I got it and used it happily but my happiness was not stay long when I realized that ink need refill. when I tried to buy cartridges, very much disappointed becoz it doesn't support refill, you have to buy new cartridges for both black/color print and for black it cost 900+ RS and Max you can print 100 copy.
so it's really costly right? you can easily get print from outside in 2/3 rs per copy max to max.
So my final suggestion would be if you are looking for your printing requirement and you think that it would cast less from outside, then you are wrong, for scanning you can go for it.",1
Product is of low cost but the due to the cost of cartridge the printer has cost me much more than that of the costly printer. Due to this 1 black and white print cost me more than 10 rupees which I can take from a cyber at Max to max 2 rupees and the colour print cost more than 20 rupees and which I can take at Max to max 10 rupees so the printer is looking of low cost but it high costing printer,1
"Cost of print can make you go bankrupt!!! If you are ready to spend
700-800 bucks on each cartridge go for it..otherwise don't...I tried a 100 ways to refill the cartridges but none of them worked...apparently this product seems a low cost thing but actually it will cost you way more when you start using it...worst product that makes fool out of people!!!",1
"this printer is a piece of crap sent by amazon, when i turn on light comes and doesnt print at all. tried reinstalling software and downloading drivers but no help. called up amazon support they gave me number to call up hp support.. i did call up and they took me to all troubleshooting but of no help. when i asked them to give me a dead on arrival letter (DOA) as was told to me by amazon,, the hp support people refused to give me saying printer is turning on and its not dead on arrival.. informed the same thing to amazon but they refused to acknowledge and help me in this... throw your money in dustbin instead of buying this printer. I was very regular at amazon but i think after this i rather move to flipkart or ebay...",1
It can't photocopy or scan an entire A4 size document. There will be parts on the bottom which will be cut off. The ink they send with the printer doesn't last very long and you'll find yourself soon looking for a new cartridge.,3
Printer is not working properly. Ink in the supplied catridge got exhausted after 30 to 35 print. This makes printing very costly as new catridge costs Rs 795 and it would give only 100 prints. Plz suggest what should i do and help me return the same.,1
"Printer is good.but the only problem is with its cartridge and its printing cost,this is not a good choice for anyone,the new cartridge gave just 80 pages black print and vanished. New cartridge cost around Rs 981. So just calculate the printing cost is about Rs 12.25/page. So i don't recommend this printer for any purpose either home or office use.",3
"Box ok but loose part inside box making noise neither Amazon nor HP ready to help unable to get solution
Ashwini Syal",1
very bad printer please dont purchase its a waste of money.the images is not clearly printing colour printer is very bad .i am not satisfied with this product worst very bad prinet.,2
Bought it 4 months back. Took hardly 10 prints and its not working. It is not a good printer if you wish to take multiple print outs. Or both side print outs. For both side print outs you will have to do it manually. I would recommend prefer some other printer,1
Sir we are so disapointed from emazon i have order a hp printer and now its not working good printing copy is not clear i have give return request and amazon call helper when we call for return he said the coriyer boy came to tell product in one day but he is not came afer again call he said he will came in 2 say but not came again he call 2 day but yet no body come to take return it back and i need printer so much i have to make many project lot of work i have to do this printer is not good so we are returing it than we order expansive printer new one so sir please help as i thik you will take action soon for this,1
"Product is not good . first time cartridge is not good after 25 print it required a Refill. after 2 months blank paper coming while taking print or Xerox .:)

Update on 28/Nov:- Never go to this product , As per the discussion with customer care I went to HP service center @Chennai . They are telling different story . If the ink is over then there is no warranty for the product and initially HP provide setup Cartridge ,it dose not cover warranty . For getting warranty we have to buy new cartridge and use .

Please don't buy this product.",1
"Who ever sees its price, find it so cheap to buy immediately but beware...

This aio printer comes with demo cartridge which hardly prints your 50 pages.

Now usually people go for refilling. On each refill it prints at most 100 pages either color or bw. So you will get refill cost of ‚Çπ0.50/page for bw and ‚Çπ1.0/page for color. But now there is as a trick, this refill idea will not stay long. After 2-3 refill your cartridges stop functioning and there you go... Now new cartridge costs you ‚Çπ800 each. So not advisable for higher print counts.

Now it's not even advisable for lower print counts because you have to print one page a week to avoid ink drying.

Better go for CISS printer",1
"One of the useless product I have purchased from Amazon, I have left more than 2 reviews and its not been highlighted. quality of the print is poor and the cartridges which come is package does not work, buying them new costs Rs.900 each, then what is the use of buying a product here.",1
"The technical specifications must contain the minimal capacity of cartridge. In absentia, customers get befooled. It hardly prints 100 pages and the cost is exorbitantly on higher side of appx ‚Çπ1,000/- per cartridge. Just imagine we are expending 3,000/- bucks for 100 pages print out, ie, ‚Çπ30/- per page...Ha ha ha and then ‚Çπ10/- per page. Can't comprehend why even HP manufactures it and Amazon sells it....",1
"There is often a problem in connecting the notebook with the printer. sometimes it takes an hour. Software says ""cant connect"" When it works it gives decent output but you never know when it will connect.

I did not know one had to bother with such basic issues.",2
Indirect cost is too much catridges last only 35 pages.refilled catridges rejected by printer.so one new catrige will cost 900 rs and that too for 35 pages.Are you serios HP.better go for epson printers.Dont buy this,3
"Printing quality is good but cartridge ink keeping capisity is poor... can't print 50 pages in one cartridge, even black and white.... good for rarely used in house works... ok to have...",2
"Should give zero star . Printer received with faulty color cartridge . Neither Amazon nor HP is ready to help . Horrible service scenario .
I just wanted faulty cartridge to be replaced .",1
"SELLER did not include Warranty card with the product , Serial number , product information missing unable to get any service from HP. also software CD sent is for another printer model. instruction manual in Chinese; no english pages.",1
"Hi Everyone,

My review on this product after buying it.

Product name:
HP DeskJet 2131 All-in-One Printer

Product after use:
I have purchased this Printer and it was amazing after unpacking, it was delivered what i saw in image while purchasing.
I am using it till now all looks good and perfect no complains till now, my suggestion this is very nice product for home use.

Advantage:
- Small and light weight
- Two cartridge available
- Easy refill of cartridge
- Easy installing new cartridge

Disadvantage:
- Bad if not used regularly
- Inks dries if not used for long time
- Need to replace cartridge if not used for long time

If you are planning for Printer at home so you can buy this product.",3
"Product is very nice and the delivery was awesome and fast by Amazon Hats off for that
But the Cartridge price is too high and it's gets over very fast
I finished my cartridge a day after I received the product only 98 pages were printed by the black cartridge",3
"this ink cartridge is very low capacity only 80 copies of A4 sheets and i am unable to refill the ink but its new cartridge price is nearly Rs.700..
its waste of money
i am very disappointed",2
"Just saw that many people are thinking to buy this product as it's price is really low. But if u are buying this for everyday usage, its a sincere advice from me to not go for this printer as the cartridge is very expensive and also dries up very soon. The black one costs around ‚Çπ800 and colour is around ‚Çπ1000. Refiling the cartridge is not a solution as u lose it printer warranty and also print quality is horrible. If u are buying a printer for everyday usage, it's better to go for ""INK ADVANTAGE PRINTER"" from HP or else Ink Tank printers are best option as u can directly put the ink in them and it is very cheap.
But talking about the print quality, it is a good printer when used with genuine HP cartridge and u can also use it for photo prints. But u cannot print both sides at once and u need to manually rotate the paper in order to do so
That's all about the printer...hit the helpful button if u are satisfied with my review...",3
"Printer and Scanner is good. Print speed and Scan speed is Ok. But do not buy this product untill and unless you are ready to pay Rs.12 per 1 page print out. Because it contains HP 803 catridge which costs Rs.827 in amazon as on today i.e. 28-07-2017 and the rate is increasing day by day. And this catridge will give you 65 to 75 pages in normal print mode. And this printer and its software will not be allowing you to refill the catridge. other brand low price catridges will also be not accepted by the printer. You must buy original 803 catridge of HP. Don't think that you can do something with youtube videos and will use the printer by refilling catridge or something. The software is unbreakable. Even if you refill, the software automatically stops printing after 100 pages or so, even though it contains enough ink. This is best suitable for corporate companies but not for normal home purpose.",1
There is some issue with this printer. We need to feed paper manually one by one sometimes other wise it doesn't work. Also make some kind of noise. Recommended to buy better one.,2
"Printer does not work. I just received the printer today. Kudos for the fast shipping.

However, the cartridges that came with the printer do not work. Printer throws error ""Black cartridge incompatible"". This is bad quality control on part of HP. Was unable to print even a single page.",1
"Good product ,but cartridge is too expensive . Only print less than 100 papers for 650 RS coast cartridge",2
"Got this product in 50% discount with delay of 10 days plus worst customer service from amazon.in, due to sample cartridge unable to print much and need to buy new cartridges which increase the cost of printer, re-fill doesn't works good for this printer, so i can't recommend amazon.in and hp 2131.",2
A STRICT NO to this product..it is not at all cost efficient..the cartridge is of nearly 700rs and gives only 200-250 copies..refilling the cartridge costs around 200rs in both the cases a single print is double the rate of a photocopy in the market. better to go for a laser jet rather than this ink jet.,1
"Ink cartridges given with the Printer are items ""Not for sale"". It appears that the contents thereof are very minimal, the Black Ink cartridge got over after hardly 25 pages prints. This was unexpected, as new cartridges are quite expensive. Secondly, no printed Manual is supplied with the Printer. To refer to the Manual on Internet or on the computer is not very user friendly, and neither it is economical to take print out of Manual for ready reference as it is prohibitive due to high cost of the ink cartridges.",3
The ink cartridge that it came with printed only near 100 pages. I know that it'll print only less pages but 100 is too low. Need to test it with new cartridges.,3
Not that good in case of color printing but the black and whites does quite a decent job - printing about a 150 - 180 pages in one cartridge,3
"this printer is not suitable for personal or office, so don't buy this printer,this printer is good for kids not for adult, so i request to the products
they argued this printer is suitable for both office and personal use in cheap price in the webpage but after i ve used this printer as my experience it is not in real they argued about this printer to increase their selling portion,so i request to all the customer don't buy this printer,",1
"An average printer.

+ quality of printing is good.
+ Scanner option is also there.
+ You can scan/print even without default app.

Improvements:
- Looks very cheap.
- printing speed is slow.
- Drinks too much of ink. (didnt last even 100 pages for B&W average quality prints)",3
"ITS OK.
COPY-- U CAN COPY ONLY 9
PRINTING--U CAN PRINT GOOD BUT ITS VERY SLOW, RESPONDS AFTER 2MINS.
SCAN-- U CAN SCAN IT.
ONLY DISADVANTAGE IS COST PER PRINT IS MORE.
GOOD FOR HOME USE NOT FOR COMMERCIAL USE.SINCE UNECONOMICAL.",3
"I bought this product at the starting of July it was good but in 2 or 3 months the promblem started the ink cartridge was very much local type , I have printed and photocopy almost 20 - 25 pages only. When I asked a cyber cafe operator nearby they said "" iske ink Sukh Gaye hai"" very much faltu and waste of money and I also want to say don't buy this product worst product ever just wastage of money and time

At the end I want to say that
I Want my money back",1
"I ordered this printer on 6th of march, 2018. I used it not more than a month and hardly would have taken a print out at the most 20 pages. Now I am unable to print anything as the ink level is not up to the mark. I reconfirmed it with local computer technician and he suggested that I need to refill the cartridges. Not satisfied with the product. I would not recommend this product to anyone.",1
50 TO 60 PAGES ONLY PER REFILL CAN BE PRINTED. BULK PRINT REQUIRES REGULAR REFILL OF INK LIKE EVERY 60 PAGES YOU HAVE TO REFILL THE INK. BUYING A NEW CARTRIDGE WILL COST YOU 800 FOR BLACK ONE SO YOU JUST CANT BUY A NEW CARTRIDGE AGAIN AND AGAIN. PHOTOCOPIER AND SCANNER WORK FINE. CAPACITY OF INK IS TOO LESS IN THE CARTRIDGE MAKING YOU REGULARLY REFILL IT. OVERALL I DIDNT LIKE IT. CANT RETURN SO STUCK WITH IT.,1
"Purchased the HP Deskjet 2131, installed it successfully on MY HP laptop. But the problem is when i give print command the first page comes blank all the time and the second page is printed. Is it a fault with the printer i want to know. Page alignment and other settings are ok, but this first page no printing is an issue.

I want to know whether i can get replacement for this or should i have to take it to local HP dealer ????
PLS REPLY SOON",3
They send one which did not work and I had to return it. Such a head ache.,1
Paper jamming issue 1 month worked printing function problems started,1
"Please don't buy this printer this is not work for the money instead of that we can get xerox and printout from some other internet shop.
The money is spending for ink a lot",1
"Sorry to notice that the product is imcomplete.
1. The cd is missing for installation ...only paper cover is there.
2. The black catridge is completely out of ink..dry and not working... colour catridge is somewhat working.

Problem is cartage needs frequent replacement.,3
It's cartridge quality is very poor because this is print only 15 pages each cartridges . I hope it is very expansive .So Please don't buy this product . This is waste of money .,1
Service is terrible. If you're lucky enough to get a good product then its great and life is beautiful...otherwise its a nightmare. I was lucky for my laptop but sadly not for my printer.,1
The printer I received had paper jam from Day 1. But thanks to Amazon I could return it.,3
"There are better printers than this one which does not work on Wifi, and that is the 2131's biggest drawback. Unfortunately I realized it too late after receiving the printer.",3
Worst printer ever! You have to buy HP cartridge after 100 pages or so. HP genuine cartridge costs me around 900 and doesn't accept refilling. That means 9rs per paper. Never go for this type of inkjet printers. I'm writing this review after 6 months.,1
dont buy this hp printer.....prints only 100 A4 size paper per cartridge......cost of cartridge is also high...... disappointed,1
Printing ink is lasting for only 50 page and cost of blank ink cartridge is 750 rs. HP is doing advertising for 10 paisa per page where as this is coming to 15 rs/page!!! It is like cheating user!! Dont bye HP printer as they are earning from INK,1
pathetic cartridge capacity ! do not buy this !! and cant be refil ! what a blade and monopoly and inconvenience to customers ! Looting HP,1
"I am feeling cheated by purchasing HP Deskjet 2131 printer . I couldn't take any printout due to cartridges issue ... Every time ink cartridges problem coming and talked to HP customer care .The ink cartridges I received is poor in quality so I have asked to return....

"Couldn't print even 25 text only pages. Cartridge got empty. People might argue that you must have given heavy print. But that's not the case.
Since I have already wasted my money. There is no going back.

"Very slim ,light weight easily carry in traveling.
Good battery time.....Min 5hrs
For office use best one.",4
"I bought this exchanging my Acer Aspire V5 intel i3 laptop since Pentium Gold processor is almost same, except for lesser L3 cache memory (3 MB to 2 MB).

There is absolutely no heating or any other issues due to SSD. This fits my requirement of day to day browsing, reading, videos etc. Very good laptop for this price.

Good price for old laptop & card discount from ICICI due to Diwali sale.",5
"initial impression is excellent...light weight,thin,travel friendly.Super fast booting,due to ssd. hop this laptop last long.lets see what happen due to corse of time.",5
"I am a Computer Technician, and i have purchased and configured 5 of these. 2 were purchased from Amazon.

Key Points.
1) Initial Setup takes around 40 minutes but after that
2) LAPTOP BOOTS IN LESS THAN 10 SECONDS (5 seconds frankly)
Yes this laptop is Super FAST, because of its m.2 ssd.
3) Clients with 3rd and 4th generation Core i5 laptops with 8 GB Rams couldnt spot the Difference in speeds. You are basically comparing a 45000rs - 65000rs year 2015 Laptops with a 2020, 30000rs. Which is just 2 core 2mb cache. Still is fast.. Thank you m.2
4) Recomended for people who want a Blazing fast laptop for Surfing, working on Excel, word.

This laptop has
1) License Lifetime Original Windows
2) License for 1 year Microsoft Office student edition (word excel one note)
3) has a 250 GB m.2 SSD Storage. (BLAZING FAST)
4) Single Slot 4 GB Ram (If you want to upgrade to 16 GB.. its going to be a Difficult Turn)

Word of Advice.
1) IF you work simultaeously on Multiple Softwares. like 6 - 10 Excel sheets or heavy programmes like Adobe, then you may consider skipping this laptop as the RAM is just 4 gb
2) Only Intel graphics but Old adobe and basic 3d softwares below 2018 works.

Its a Value for Money. I am waiting for Competition like DELL and LENOVO to launch their varients so prices will drop. in 2 years.",4
"Worst service from Amazon and the seller. After buying this laptop I found that it's not suitable for running Android studio and I wanted to return it to get a higher configuration laptop but to my surprise I can't return it, the very next day. I was in the impression that we can return any item on Amazon but that was my biggest mistake and I lost 25k. This laptop is useless for me. Not happy at all.",1
"I am writing this review after using the laptop for one month.
1) The MS office 2019 is original , just activate when you recieve it by login into your microsoft account. If you don't have a microsoft account create it.
2) The laptop boots in just 3 to 4 second. It is very fast on SSD.
3) The shutdown also takes just 3 second, thus you save your valuable time.
4) The processing is also very reasonable and good at this price.
5) It work for about 7 hour in one charge.
6) Autocad 2017 is working fine on it.
7) Overall the performance of the laptop is very good.
One can buy it without any doubts.",5
This is very bad product from Amazon there is no bill and window is local . it hangs full time I want a complete solution regarding this,1
"It's Amazing! I have never ever thought the SSD can be so fast that the Windows will boot In just 5 seconds!
I Really Loved the HP Laptop with Windows 10 Home + Office 2019 Students already included lifetime.
The only reason for choosing this Laptop over the One with Ryzen A9 APU available on other ecommerce site, & choosing the Pentium 4417U is that, it's faster than the Ryzen.
I really love this lightweight laptop & it's compactness makes it worth.
This laptop is really great if you want windows office and a powerful processor with SSD in this segment of upto ‚Çπ28,000 /-",5
Sound problem,1
"Purchased this laptop on 29th October 2019.

Writing a review after almost 1 year of usage. To start with this laptop is very quick to start when powered on, hardly takes 5 seconds to start up.

Great for those with basic requirements like daily surfing, Watching movies, MS office, Excel, Powerpoint and basic editing tasks. Due to SSD it works like charm.

Pros
- SSD makes it pretty fast with 5-7 seconds boot and start time. (I checked higher end models in shops but could not find one that starts as quickly this)
- Light weight, this is pretty light and easy to carry, my earlier samsung laptop used to weigh almost 2 kgs and this slim trim piece comes as a delight to me in terms of weight.
- Great battery life, haven't found any problems with battery life till now. It works 6-8 hours on a single charge easily. For me it is on almost for the entire day and it still works great.
- Great volume, I am yet to see a laptop with so crystal clear sound. Most laptops have very low volume.
- Got windows 10 and MS office students version license with it which is great add-on at this price point. (many higher priced laptops also don't provide this).

Cons
- Well almost none for me considering my requirements but you can find difficulties with viewing angles and screen resolution while watching movies, but I have no complains for it at this price point.

Conclusion
A great value for money laptop at this price point, After one year I can say that I am pretty happy with the purchase.",5
One of the worst company and laptop available on Amazon...laptop is not working after 6 month use..and worst part is hp customer support they will first waste ur 4-5 days by just doing similar troubleshooting then send some moron technician again this cycle will go on but the problem of laptop will never be resolved...so never buy this laptop,1
Microsoft not working properly. Is it a defective piece,1
"Delivered one day earlier. Windows 10 and MS office Home & Student activated easily.
USB ports are very tightly fitting. Speakers quality just good. Battery approx 5 hours.

Reviewed after one day of use.",5
 This is a very bad laptop. Do not take it. It hangs and stops running. I have been compelled on amazon many times but they have taken it so far,1
"Writing this review after 6 months use. Got it for my daughters online classes. No problem till now. Start and shut down in 2 sec.. pretty fast.
Pls go for it if you want basic laptop for regular use and browsing.
Preinstalled Microsoft Office is a plus.
Only con is Camera is very bad but its ok for me coz i don't use it.",5
Price wise it is a good buy. Major drawback is outer body build quality as the body is not metallic and feels more like card board type. Also battery cannot be removed from outside. It is made in China.,1
This is very very low class product. not working perfectly. hanging in the middle of the programme. customer care is not responding. i made big mistake for buying this product.,1
Don't buy this product.. Return policy is not available.,1
Its slow as hell and also only after using for 10 days the alphabet markings are rubbing off and disappearing from the keys on keyboard. A very sub standard product.,1
"The processor is so fast , it's really good for office work and watching movies go for it...",5
"Cant believe it's a HP Laptop. I don't think people should consider buying Laptop from Amazon.

Amazon team don't take any accountability post the Product is sold. They sell through Partners and possibly fake products. The HP laptop INR >25K didnot last even for 3 months.

Few pointers,
- The Laptop didnot have a Serial Number (there is NO sticker label pasted on the body of the Laptop).
- Thereafter I called up Amazon and raised this issue ... at first they did not acknowledge the problem. Finally, they accepted. However, NO resolution was provided.
- Performance of the Laptop - the less you talk about it , the better it's. Its pathetically slow and HDD has already crashed. In terms of Config, it's 4GB/1TB HDD however the performance is worse than my 4 early old Laptop.

It was a terrible experience for me. People should reconsider before buying from Amazon.",1
"Its a good student laptop and you can go for it.
Not for gaming or running too much of multi-tasking. Support mentions it can be upgraded to 8GB RAM , still need to check it out. RAM slot support mentions is 1 but shows 2 on the system properties.
Overall a good laptop for this price and its light weight too.",5
"Pros - light weight, good battery life
Cons - with antivirus , and other high end softwares laptop is dead slow. Booting is slow when you use it first time.

How to improve performance - uninstall Mcafee from the system. Disable unwanted programs in the start up. Disable express VPN.

Update: Web camera stopped working after 3 days.. initially I thought it's an issue of Windows driver ... Gave the laptop to HP service center and they confirmed laptop has a faulty camera hardware ... HP must have a proper quality assurance mechanism ...",2
"Really a good but not wonderful product, backup is great, charging very fast, windows 10 is licensed and free forever, MS Office is not free. It boots not very fast, we can attent phone calls, sms of phone, photos on phone very easily, need not go and take your phone to attend or make calls or sms. It is not for gaming or movies, though good enough for YouTube etc. Need patience to wait for opening apps like skype, trello, hunter, even note pad opens very slow.",3
"Excellent laptop. Beats macbook air in every department other than battery life, which is about 7 hours. Reviewed after six months usage",5
"MS Office won't come with this by default. We ha e to pay for it with additional cost ranging from 6k to 9k. Was not awaeaboit it & bought. Realized there is only one month trial version provided & as it was given to my daughter she could make out only after 2 weeks that she is not able to work on her ppt projects. Reaching back to Amazon, Microsoft & HP no one helped. They have not even provided supplier details & product key. No one is ready to help. So please don't buy this , it's a big mistake from my side going for this product. Please be careful.",1
Just few days but in love with the product ... its light and i like the large fonts on the keypad ... pre installed windows 10 and its easy to set up .. I m Loving IT ;),5
"The laptop is good but windows10 is quiet heavy which makes booting and opening apps very slow.
Preferred config for windows 10 would be SSD, min 8GB RAM and quad core processor with 3 ghz or faster.

Of the 4gb available RAM, only 3.4gb RAM is usable as rest is used as graphics memory and 2.4gb is used by windows and basic applications. Hence only 1gb RAM is available for all other applications which is generally not enough.

The same laptop would be faster with windows7 but unfortunately it is no longer available or supported by Microsoft.

But a perfect laptop for basic usage and online classes. Do not expect quick responses while opening apps as the processor is always running in overclocked mode.

Tried installing windows 7 as dual boot but not sure if the laptop drivers available in hp website work for windows 7. If it doesn't work then it doesn't serve the purpose.",3
"I bought this laptop 4 days ago and I found laptop is not worthy for use, even you can not run properly word, excel and othe file ,very very slow it will take time each and every single time, you can't play games, if you install game in laptop it will start hanging immediately unless you have to uninstall the game, you can not add extra ram because they don't have provided extra ram slot, even there is not extra slot to add SDD, there is no fan in laptop for cooling and once you buy this laptop you can not refund your money only replacement with same piece even if you want to return and add extra money to but another you can't. Please I suggest if anybody is willing to buy this laptop plz don't buy you regret it 100% so please don't buy.",2
"If you are looking for a laptop for work from home or office use you should go for it without a second thought. Because of its great battery backup and speed due to SSD. Also it's lightweight and good looking too.
But if you are looking for a laptop which should be both good for Work and Gaming you should consider buying another one, because of its low processor and graphics card. It's not good for gaming. You will get good average gaming laptops with more specifications under 40 - 50K if you are lucky.",4
"I don‚Äôt know where to start. I have never expected a laptop manufactured during the last decade to be this slow.

Looking at the spec, I recommended this laptop to my friend as he just wanted a smooth functioning laptop for very basic usage. We got the delivery on time with a good packaging however the very first time we turned on the machine it took forever. I told him since it‚Äôs the first boot it might have taken time but updating the windows updates would fix it.

It‚Äôs been more than a month now, no sign of any improvement. My 11 year old MacBook works like a charm in comparison with this Pathetic laptop.(I know this very absurd comparison)

We already lost the return window and have no idea how to go about with it.

The worse purchase I‚Äôve ever made on Amazon.

I urge people to go through reviews properly before making a decision which you‚Äôd regret.",1
"Reveiw after 10 days :
Worst Don't buy these kind of products
Battery life 1hr
Hanging for every 1 sec
Booting time 10 mnts
Heating = You can cook anything
Finally Worst.. Worst... Worst...

This reveiw is from IT employee (ME) in INFOSYS BPM LMT Banglore..
If you still want to buy... Sure you can...",1
"This is externally poor product, looks like mot of the review online are fake. This system takes lot of time to reboot. Even the computers with 1GB RAM is faster than this. Application doesn't open within 30 seconds, many a times application becomes unresponsive for a minute before opening.
In the same configuration other vendors laptop are much cheaper, still bought this for brand Name - its not worth.
All review online with system reboots in 10 - 15 seconds are fake.
Color display is horrible, doesn't matter how fast your internet is none of the streaming apps works and its not internet speed issue since it works on Web browser.
It doesn't have as good battery life as advertise.",1
"Pros:-
It is really very light weight
Its very fast also
If you don't require much space go with this it prodiess awesome speed ,
Boot ups in 5 sec ,

Cons:-
You have to compromise with storage
But a external hard drive would work good

No fingerprint of face id ,

Lower processor

, But overall value for money, and its quality is also good ,
(Review after one day of usage)",4
"Worse laptop ever ,sound n video quality is good for zoom class ,but the system always keeping on hanging jad to call sopport ,have no proper response as well ,not able to open 2 windows as it's always been gating hanged so frustrating this laptop is ,please go for dell I have brought a dell 5 years back still working amazingly, unfortunately I had left that at home brought this hp product to do my work .worse experience ever .",1
"It is very fast and light weight laptop. I recommend this, because of value of money. It is really faster than i3 laptops. Good to go...",5
This laptop has stopped working just after using it for two weeks. I do not know if this is a fake product.,1
"The product is slow like a turtle. Shame on the professor. Only good for browsing, that too takes long because of entered words to appear, or to open chromeüôÜ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I can't believe I just lost 25K for this",1
"The Laptop is offered at a reasonable price however it has not been functioning. The entire booting is slow,the keyboard and touchpad doesn't respond, I have already wasted my time in factory reset and recovery done with no backups, I was told that a technician would visit but he did not and instead he updated the status as not contactable,I requested for another technician who came but did not submit the report.Now,I am told that another technician will come on 3rd August to verify. So,basically I spent money to go through all these hassles and not focus on the purpose of the purchase. Amazon has not fulfilled the 10 days replacement policy. Guys,remember, the product can be faulty but the service should be such that one should have confidence and it looks like Amazon has become a degraded after sales Company.",1
"The Laptop is quite light and very fast, especially when starting the OS. The only con is the storage space when compared to the traditional drives, which again is a part of the specification. Overall a good buy!",5
"This laptop has 4GB RAM. But Microsoft teams needs 4GB RAM over and above system requirements.
So this laptop cannot handle teams and will freeze making the laptop unusable.
Do not buy this laptop if you intend to use MS teams.

This review is written after 7 days of constant use and lots of troubleshooting with HP experts to resolve the laptop freezing issue.",1
"Small product and on the laptop body there designing grip
And it's SSD drive is awesome it takes max 3-4 second for startup and max 2 second for shutdown
This is happening coz of ssd drive I suggest u to if u have basic use then go for it",4
"Not saying it's completely waste, i trust hp for laptops from years, as i have 2 already at home. But particularly this model performance is below par considering the specifications, should've gone for Intel processor rather than amd. *lags too much, high end softwares like autocad, sketch, coral draw, photoshop isn't compatible or recommended for this variant, it sucks!

*The only solution for lagging on this model is, you've to insert atleast 240GB SSD for smooth experience which cost around 3500/-",2
"Got this laptop yesterday and used for 1 day. Its total waste of money. Its cpu is so low such that even if you open a chrome its showing 100% usage. Bought it for my kids online class but google meet is hanging completely if you open video. You need to power off the laptop to get out of meeting. Its too low only fit for MS word or note pad activity.

I called every customer care to check whether its possible to upgrade but none helping.

Total waste of money never buy it.",1
this product didnot work properly according to my desires,2
"Don't get carried away by price . Not suitable for graphic designers, anyone into photoshop of visual mediums through computer..graphics are terrible, colors are muddled and dark.
I should have.done better research.
What I do like about it is it's very light weight and airy !",3
Many review is sayings it‚Äôs SSD but the description is HDD and I got HDD it takes normally around 10 mins to boot up and very very slow laptop.,1
"Just OK product for daily basic functions like browsing, Spread sheet and Word editing.

Comes with a Windows 10.
Doesn't include MS office.
Good resolution.
Battery backup for 4 hr max (if you are playing music and videos)",3
Value for the money...Best budget lap ever...,5
"Nothing to dislike in this price range, I bought it for content writing and seo article writing. Though Microsoft 365 is in trial version but I simply have a way around it. However I would suggest you guys to use hp and macfee collaborated security. Overall I am loving it let's see how long it sustains.",5
"MS Office was valid for 4 days only, seller has not mentioned complete details. It's cheating. Pls do not buy as it will waste if you purchase MS office of Rs 5K. Instead invest this 5k to buy more advanced version along with MS office access too.",3
"This laptop is best in it's price range :) But DON'T buy this laptop for gaming purpose . It is only good for normal day to day uses like surfing, photo editing, etc.
‚úÖAlthough Battery backup is awesome. It charges quickly!
‚úÖDisplay is average *
‚úÖThis is not a light weight laptop ^
‚úÖProcessing speed is SLOW* also sometimes it hangs too.
‚úÖAllover I am happy with this laptop cause I do normal work (I don't play games üòÖ )& I recommend you to buy this if your budget is under 25000‚Çπ",3
"Item as described, super fast delivery. Will review the laptop after a few weeks of use.",5
Very slow and crashing a lot. I pushed this mainly for my daughter's online classes. Any video calling app makes the laptop to crash after 20 mins. My daughter not able to attend classes properly with this. With no app running Ram usage is 80%. Never buy this for kids online classes,1
"Review after using it for 2 weeks continuously:

1. The system is a bit slow to start, but after initial start it's fine.
2. Best for office use.
3. No heating issues.
4. Battery lasts upto 8-9 hours for a normal office use.
5. Light weight. Easy to carry.
6. Do not expect to play games like pubg, cod, etc. It will give you a bad gaming experience.

Overall it's a good laptop at this pricing for a normal use.",4
"I brought it in exchange of my old one for my daughter s school. All was pre installed.

Speed is very good. After pressing the switch it's make it ready in know time. Almost 20 days over no operational issus detected.",5
Out of the box and found out that this ones horribly slow. Take way too long to open simple chrome browser. Waste of money,1
"Why this product is available on Amazon, if it is faulty. Too many people already complained about it. I purchased on the name of brand but I was wrong this product should be immediately removed from Amazon. This product is too slow to do anything on it. No one wants to take laptop sit for hours just to visit a website or for any nominal task.
It keeps on hanging, not responds to commands. Don't buy.",1
discovered a defected software within the first 5hrs of use which the hp guys can't even fix and they won't let you return. Don't buy this product unless you want to donate your cash. The hp team will be brutal when you contact them. Wish i could give them a 0 star rating.,1
"The speed is very slow even to just see the photos and videos.. sole purpose I‚Äôve purchased this laptop is to watch movies and surf stuffs, see photos tu is but it‚Äôs even slower for this basic operations .. display screen is extremely shady and glare .. if you‚Äôre watching movie just aside then you won‚Äôt be able to see the picture",4
"The laptop is too slow , it's been about 4 , 5 months since I bought this laptop bit have not been able to get any work done on it! The customer service is ridiculously slow . Did a system recovery as suggested by the customer care and it somehow managed to ruin my harddrive! Pls don't buy.",1
"It is a good bargain for me, I used it for a week and then upgraded the RAM to 8 GB, and it improves its performance well.

Good for basic use: online classes, etc.",3
"My son cannot attend school sessions which happens on microsoft team.
The product hangs only with teams running with no other applications. I have optimized all startup programs, settings on microsoft teams (h/w acceleration, animation off etc). But teams sucks the processor and RAM.

Hence this product doesnt serve the purpose, if you are going to use microsoft teams.",1
Even pentium IV processors worked very fast compared to this processor. The worst laptop i have ever seen. AMD is a garbage. The whole windows 10 freezes after an hour. Remove windows 10 and use linux for gods sake. Seriously!!! 24k is wasted.,1
"Please check before buying...I am not happy with the service of hp.its look like a toy....sorry toys are better then this .....very slow ...I am giving 3 marks out of 10......you can use this laptop only for Facebook,email,movies only......for.other work you need other laptop for office work ......say no to online ....no one can listen you.

Waste of money ......",1
"I purchased this Product after reading many Reviews, expecting a good product. But when I received the product, look was the only thing that attracted me.

It's too slow. Only a word or an excel file takes 4 minutes to open. Can not even work for normal office things.",2
The system crashes every time during use. I want to return this product. 1st time facing such bad service issue from Amazon. Its says before returning technician will come. Since last 2days they are supposed to come..no one is calling or coming. I want to return this laptop. Its really defective.,1
Poor performance.. Do not buy this item.. Gets hang every time... just bought the new laptop and even online classes are no possible on the laptop.,1

"This is a junk product by HP , the performance is extremely poor and I use it only for internet surfing . The laptop constantly freezes , i can understand if this was on one laptop . I have 8 and all 8 demonstrate the same performance issue . Moreover , one of the laptop does boot after just 4 weeks . DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.",1
"This laptop is being used primarily for online classes/tuition and for checking emails, viewing Youtube videos, internet surfing for which is more than meets the purpose. Additionally, MS Office usage is also without any issues or delays. As an entry level laptop, it meets all my expectations.",5
Great laptop for the price. Fast and light. Does the job,5
"A nice laptop with all enough features....Recommended to friends,but,unfortunately unavailable now.",5
Best compared to price.Its slick and light weight. Working smooth since last 1 month. It does lag a bit if you download heavy apps but its acceptable with this price range.,5
"The product is little slow, and Microsoft 365 not included. If you want to buy this than you have to also buy the Microsoft office apart from this . I‚Äôm using this last three days it is too slow if you have open three or more programs then you have to wait for some minute because it is going hang.",2
Firstly thhis lap top was delivered in the night which is unusual. Secondly the speed is slow and gets hanged frequently. I strongly suspect the system has been opened and some wrong doing has happened . The performance is very very POOR. Gaming? What a joke... cannot run teams continuously for 10.mins!,1
" I dont know what to say. Usually window 10 sucks. It takes more than 2 min to reboot.
I had to click more than 5 time to start a chrome.

I am taking to a hp storeroom to install window 7 and remove this window 10.",3

Don't buy this product. Processor is extremely slow and mousetrap is not working properly. Everytime it shows program is not responding whenever I open any file or browser. It won't provide Microsoft 365 student version also. I am not happy with this product. Totally waste of money.,1
Plastic is not that much great. Performance is good and battery backup is good,4

Very useless product. Not able to use it for my child online classes it was very purpose I had purchased... After numerous calls to HP I was told to increase RAM to 8 GB... Even after doing that it is still not working.... please don't buy this product,1

"The laptop is good only for doc work and net surfing.
Issue being pentium gold is a weak processor and only good for battery saving.

If you think of anything else like gaming or development using IDE please buy an 8th gen core i3 or AMD Ryzen 3 3200u or above laptop.
BTW ryzen 3 laptops are cheaper and perform as good and have better integrated graphics.(so save money and put that in more RAM and ssd)

Also it has only single RAM slot, so you would never be able to run it on dual channel memory .
Please remember dual channel ram + ssd is the key to smooth performance.
Ssd alone will only make startup and shutdown fast but applications benefits from more memory bandwidth.",1
"It's no doubt that this laptop is a great buy. It sells for this cheap price and you are still getting the best of it.
But if you want something even better with the same money for value aspect then definitely go for this Acer laptop over here

JUST SO YOU KNOW ITS A 14inch laptop and it doesn't comes with a DVD drive.

-Build quality-top notch with light weight design.
-Battery life- great, 6hours plus
-Performance-smooth
-Display-good
-Track pad - more than usable
-Lifetime WINDOWS 10
-Permanent MICROSOFT OFFICE ACTIVATION
-SSD drives which makes your system fly
What else do u need...",5
"I have found 2 issues with the HP laptop I bought from Amazon . It‚Äôs a 2 week old laptop as per date .

The HP laptop often looses wifi connectivity. I never had issue with wifi on other laptops I used earlier . I had to reconnect to wifi manually and again the connection drops . I have little or no confidence whether the laptop would stay connected to wifi .

The other issue is the print on the keys of the laptop . Print started to fade already . With a bit more laptop usage , the print on the Keys E, R, D,C and V will appear much lighter than the rest of the keys . Overall not very much satisfied with my purchase .",2
"Within 5 months of purchase the internal SATA HDD crashed. 1TB Western DIgital internal HDD. Battery is amazing 10 hours backup with 1 hour fast charge, keyboard feels like Mac Keyboard, DIsplay is amazing. Now i have replaced the internal HDD with Solid State Hard drive which has increased the speed to reasonable speed, but the Western Digital internal HDD was giving pathetic speeds. Also note , onle 1 RAM slot is giving on motherboard, which has 4GB Ram, if you want to upgrade to 8GB or higher ,this RAM is wasted.",1
Don't buy,2
"At this price point it is a reasonable laptop. SSD make it super fast. Couple of drawbacks to be aware of: Display is only HD. If you are used to Full HD, you will immediately feel the dull display. The Wifi adapter supports only 2.4 GHz. This is very disappointing, since nowadays even a 10K phone has dual channel Wifi. However, this can be easily fixed with a USB wifi dongle.",3

"It is really surprising how flipkart deliver product, without testing the product. When i receive the Canon Pixma MG2470, after instalation it is not working. When I called the Canon Customer Care, they told that printer is already damage, you have to wait for 7 days to get new parts, because it is not available right now.

I am really confuse, what to do i will replace or wait for 7 days for new parts. It is really pathetic service.",1
Not a good product,1

i think, no any one can buy this printer.",1
"I just bought this printer 2 month ago. Its black Ink hardly lasted 20 pages.
In market its cartridge is too expensive.
Its better to take print out from Market .
Its new cartridge don't even last 80 pages and cost of cartridge is 800 bucks .
market print out cost is 2 rs .
So even you get product in free don't buy. In longer terms it will be damn expensive , better to go with HP.
What i learnt after buying this product is check out for cost of cartridge how much pages it will last.Even that...",1

"Received the product next day of ordering and the product is faulty and showing Erorr 5011 And Erorr -5100.

"I bought after saw very low prices 2400, they will give youbdemo catridge whcih will take around 30 pages, then after you have to purchase from market good quality will coat you around 900 for single catridge.

"Price of printer = Its ink cartridges ( Yes, its true ! )
Infact sometime ink cartridges cost more than its price. I talked to canon about number of pages it can print (180) with a set of new cartridges..now here is the math I did..
color ink - INR 1355 (CL746)
black ink - INR - 899 (PG745)
Total cost - 2254
Now you can not use 100% of this ink in printing

"Pros:
1. Decent Product for home use (only for printing and copying). Printing speed is average. Easy to troubleshoot

Cons:
1. Configuring scanner is a big head-ache. The driver given along with the product wont be compatible or have some issues with Win7(I tried with 2 laptops and a desktop). Communicated with Canon support to sort it out. But again stopped working in a months time
2. Makes lot of noise while printing.

Verdict:
You can use this product only for printing and copying. I...",2

scanning option is seen anywhere. printing and coping is clear and good. good for homely use.",2
"You'd better not to buy this. Yes, printer cost is comparatively low and print quality is also excellent. But what about the printing cost? Highly expensive. Ink cartridges (XL) cost is more than that of the printer itself. No other similar cartridges available in the market so that you have an option which one to buy.
Better not to buy it, event if it is a cheap and good quality. We have to keep in mind- A printer is not a show-piece; it has to print day to day.",2
"Product quality is good. But the Ink cartridge is small with the printer in two numbers (ie. Colour & black) Refill cartridge cost above Rs.800/-.

"Friends, you don't buy this Canon Printer MG2470. I got cheated from Flipkart after buying this printer. My fault is, I had purchased this printer without reading any reviews. It is better to read these reviews before purchasing a canon printers. The cost of the printer is some how less but the cartridges cost is extremely high and from each cartridge we can't take printouts more than 50 pages. Better go for Laser Jet Printers with Toner cartridges.",2

"Hey..! I've been using this canon pixma as my first printer for about 6 months..!

Pros : It is really cost efficient..my usual cartridge refill last about 2 months of basic home usage+projects

Cons :
Sometimes dont give efficient results.some smudges and print on paper
Paper takes too much time to get recieved in printer
Overall its a good product but only recomment it for home use.üéÄüéÄ",3
it works amazing with low cost printing quality is very nice . well product,3
printer is good but only give 100-150 black and White And 50-70 colour page in Starter Cartidge. And thr Photo Printing is Not Good... I recommend you to go for better printer. u can only use it if you are student.,3
it's compact for colour .it's too use 650 copies colours.and throw it. just use like use and throw product . simplyfy if one colour copy is 5 rupees the how much for 650 copies it's very useful,3
This printer works only 2 months after refined ink not work in perfectly,3
"Got a printer - All in one - for a steal!! Less than 3k is just good. That too, Canon.
Performance is good but i am sure the ink is going to cost a lot. Hope it gives sufficient prints on a full cartridge.
What i don't like about it is, it makes a lot of noise when fetching the paper in order to start printing. First i felt as if some part is broken. It was too loud. But then i realized, it is maybe because of the cost cutting that some things were compromised.
Another issue is that it doesn'...",3

This printer is nice print quality is also good u can print photographs on photo paper with good quality ...start goes a little bad bad later it was good ...its a nice printer if u buy it at a discounted price given by flipkart...and yes it's not for office use but surely for home use..,3
if it is working properly then it is best choice for home but when not working it is worst .... its cartridge cost is very high ... its cartridge is not refillabe ... once i refilled its cartridge but aftr refilling it didn't work ...,3
printer is in good condition and its worth of price i got this only for 1800 . by purchasing through mobile app. and this printer is only suitable for home purpose.,3
"i received this printer much before the standard delivery date, kudos to flipkart for fastest delivery.

The Product is a good and user friendly, however very slow in printing in comparison to HP all in one printer also the INK received along with printer gave hardly 70 prints in Black and white before it finished, Colour print wasn't used much hence not sure about how long it will last and price for a black ink cartridge is approximately between 800- 900 rupees.

The Scanner works pretty wel...",3
Product is very good but cartage is very expensive so don't buy this product in hol life,3

"First, I was mainly purchasing these headphones for the wireless and battery features. What I received was a great quality sound, and greater battery life than stated.

Pros:
- Battery Life - This was one of the biggest reasons for purchasing these headphones. I was looking for a set of headphones that would last longer than 4-6 hours and stumbled across these. I run the headphones for ~6-7hrs a day for four days. On the fifth day, I run the headphones until they turn off on their own. This normally happens around noon. This gives me a battery life of about 28-32 hours, beyond the stated 25 hours.

- Great Design ‚Äì I fell in love with headphone, from the time I set my eyes on it. It is stunning looking and great design.

- Sound Quality - The old headphones I was replacing with these were kind of tinny in sound quality. These headphones have really rich deep bass. I was extremely pleased with the sound.

Overall, it checks all boxes for a stunning Headphone at a very affordable price. I am very satisfied with my purchase.",5
"The product quality seemed to be Better in the intial usage but began to cause crackling noise.

Has a cushion and beautiful design but functionally it's not good upto it's pricing.

Note: Boltt also promises to give you a free movie ticket and gaana subscription if you upload screenshot of it's review on Amazon but cheats you once you have upadted the review.

It does not give you the codes.",1
"Good budget range Bluetooth headphone. It's very comfortable with soft padding, but don't expect the quality of premium ones like Sennheiser or Bose.
The connectivity is awesome, it justifies the Bluetooth 5.0 tag. The pairing is super quick and connectivity is super stable and the range is remarkable. Now that's a relief.
The best thing about these is the audio sharing feature. If your TV or Android box can support only one Bluetooth headset at a time, with the 6.5 mm audio cable option you can share audio to any other wired headphones you have. It also has a separate 3.5 mm slot if the battery runs out, and sound is just as good as in the wireless mode.
It's sound quality is at par with my Audio Technica ATH M20x, with more bass response compared to M20x, though the highs and mids are a bit more crisp and clearer in the M20x.
Battery life is awesome, it lasted for three days now with an average use of about 4 hrs per day, and as per the battery indicator on my smartphone, there's around 40 percentage left. That's quite remarkable compared to other budget headphones in the market.
The only complaint I have is the build quality of the headband which is not really great and not very stretchable.
I haven't checked on the call clarity since that's not the purpose for which i purchased them.
Overall it's a great pair and I hope they last just as long as promised. There's also a Gaana subscription and a free movie ticket if you rate them in Amazon. But obviously I didn't take it as I wanted to be fair with my review. I guess it does justify it's rating on Amazon.",4
"This is a first impression for the Fire-Boltt Blast 1400 Over-Ear Bluetooth Wireless Headphones. Before you read further you should know that when you buy the headphone, you will get a warranty subscription along with a 3 month Gaana HD+ subscription and a free movie voucher for Bookmyshow. The only way you can register for warranty is once you have left a review here on amazon. Having said that, this impression is completely non-biased.

Build Quality - The headphones are huge. I have a pumpkin sized head and I was pleasantly surprised that they turned out to be bigger than I thought. Build quality is superb for a headphone in this price range. The vertical and sideways swivel mechanism is smooth and sturdy making it quite portable and able to fit any head shape. The arching hinge is made of thin aluminium making it light, flexible but sturdy. The ear cushions are quite soft and don't irritate my ears at all. BUY A HARD CASE, so it always stays protected when you travel with it.

Sound Quality - (I have tested the quality based on usage with my MacBook Air and One Plus 7T) The passive noise cancellation seems to work well. The ear cups work well in preventing sound leaking out and seeping in. Bass is decent. It is clear but there is no thump to it even when you max out your volume. The Lows could be clearer. The mids and highs are definitely crystal clear. I have tested it both through the audio jack and Bluetooth on both devices and the quality through the audio jack sounds better (no surprise there). Overall I'd say sound quality is quite good, not excellent nor great compared to other headphones in this price range. But the overall package added with the passive noise cancellation is great I'd say.

If you can wait for the price to drop below 3000, then this pair of Headphones is an absolute no brainer of a buy. Considering that it is portable, wired/wireless and has passive noise cancellation, I'd say it will suit the needs of a budding audiophile cum music producer as well. NOTE - I don't know why the website says Google/Siri assistant built-in. It doesn't have that unless I am an idiot and cannot find it.",4
Good,4
"pros

- this headphone have great battery life
- sound quality is also good
- best headphone to buy in this price range just by first look
- good customer service
- After using for 2 months both ear-cubs came out of housing, and it was without single drop, but i got replacement from customer service.

cons

- it is beeping very frequently even if it have 30% battery remaining, it may be fixed by company after referring this issue in future, so it's not severe issue",5
"my point of view - i was mainly looking for a decent looking, solidly built, collapsible, with Mic, Good battery life, Over the Ear BT headphones at a bit reasonable price point of 3k-4k upto 6k around budget.

Initially i only wanted to buy much popular brands like Sony, JBL, and other known brands.
I found no headphones that was satisfying all my needs, a few are available but their mixed reviews stopped me from buying them.

About Boltt Blast 140- So obviously this has all Those feature i mentioned above, and at this price point this is a good deal, sound quality is decent, the bass is okay, to make calls is smooth, battery(450mAh) life seems promising but this is something that will take some months to come to an opinion, becuase batteries show their true color after an year or so. The pack comes with an aux cable and charging cable along with 2 perks(free coupons) to use and a Warranty instruction card.

So far so good, will add to review in future.

Update : this lasted for 1 year, after that it's one plastic hook that was broken and there was nothing I can do about.... It hanging now... But still working. But can't fix that plastic part it is ruptured when broke. I am not sure if my daughter dropped it or how it got broken... So not commenting on it... But yes it has that kind of delicate mechanism there which may break if handled without care.....",4
"Review for Boltt Blast140
I have used Sony,JBL,Sennheiser headphones before
Pros:
1.Ear-cups are comfortable and wearing for a long time does not hurt.
2.Frequency response spectrum is quite good and the bass is also pretty good.
3.The included cable for charging is long
4.The Wireless connectivity is good
5.In the wired format they have included a 2.5 jack to studio jack connector but the product also works with a dual sided 3.5 mm jack as well as dual sided 2.5 mm jack so yay for that.
6.There is a thicker than usual layer of padding even beneath the ear cups which is a huge plus.
7.Build Quality is really on par with the top contenders.
8.They don't feel heavy for some reason even though they are said to be 390 grams probably due to the amazing padding on the head rest.
Cons:
1.Ears get a warm after 3 to 4 hours of use.(But do note that the conditions outside were also quite hot)
2.For the same sound Intensity :Wireless mode ->100% volume ,while in Wired mode->60% Volume .
3.Build Quality is good but the polishing work could have been better.

So all in all the product is Built Well,Has a good Bass ,Frequency spectrum response is good(Balanced noise),Noice cancellation is also GOOD and it looks clean.
Its Cheap at price at around Rupees.2800 but is on par with more expensive Headphones such as JBL55BT,JBL650BT etc.",5
"I was impressed by the reviews on Amazon and ordered this product. Let me tell both the positive as well as negative reviews.

Positive:
I was impressed with the bass and sound quality and the quality of the product. Overall good.

Negative:
But after getting the product and using for a whole day, I got to know that there's a connectivity problem with the AUX cable from which I was able to hear only one side of the headphone, and also my callers were not able to hear me properly when I connected through Bluetooth on mobile. So I returned and got a replacement. But unfortunately, I faced the same issues and returning it again.

It is up to you if you want to try the product and share your reviews.",1
"Every thing is fine with the device in terms of blue tooth connectivity, sound quality, durability quality etc...

I bought this headphones for recording audio. When you speak, each of your word is shadowed with notice or dissonance in the back ground. Sine my main purpose is not served i gave average reading of 3. Not only this headphone, but the other headphones available in the market like mi, boat are also having the same issue.",3
"Initial review
The sound quality not seems to be excellent but under this price range this is awsome. Writing this review immediately after it have been delivered so not sure about the backup, Build quality is good , I have tried JBL headset that is more costlier than this one but the BOLT build quality is superior than other model with in same price range
After one week :
The charge indicator goes off after half an hour, I am doubtful that the headset is charging even if its connected bcz the charge indicator goes off and I am not getting 25H of playtime mentioned it in the product description

After One year
One of the headphone speaker not working now and outer leather wrapping start to peel off from 6 th month onwards",1
"Premium wireless Over ear Headphones
1) Battery life more than expected.
2)Build quality is top notch with stunning look.
3)Soft cushions, can be wore for long hours.
4)Bass and treble are enhanced with 32 ohms of impedance which can be easily drive by any smartphone.
5)Best for listening EDM's
This Headphones is awesome for the price range.",5
"Good over the ear headphones with inbuilt mic.
Speaker quality is quite good.
Mic is non reliable. At times people will be able to hear you, at other times you will need to shout to get your voice across.
Biggest problem is battery low alert. It starts at 30 percent and alerts every 30 seconds. This renders the device practically unusable after the battery drops down to 30 percent or lower.",3
" Horrible service. DONT BUY THESE The headphones have a manufacturing defect.
1. Mic pics up lots of noise irrespective while on bluetooth or cable.
2. There is a loose part in the left headset which is making annoying clicking noise.

Today is the fifteenth day since I have been requesting for a service but no response. There is no customer care number. Just a form to be filled and at the end of which they show a message reading someone will contact you in 5-7 days. But I haven't received any calls from them.

Disgusting to see horrible support for a decent product. I wish I could get it returned.",1
"The only complaint I have with it is the cable length. It is short for use on PC which is primary device. But for mobiles which will always be in hands or in the pockets, not a big deal. Bluetooth is amazing! loud sounds, clear, and each and every sound can be appreciated separately! Bass is good too. It is not overpowering as to dampen other sounds. Great buy! Waited like a month for these to come back in stock! The ear pads are SOFT and BIG so they completely cover my ears as much as they envelope them. :) I used BOAT for 3 years (still am) before these and they are still going strong! but the ear cusps are ON EAR not OVER EAR so this is a good change. watching YouTube streams, or listening to a variety of songs, playing games like BIOSHOCK, PUBG, DOTA, SEKIRO, CoD, DRAGON AGE, etc feels amazing on this one!",5
"Hello,

It is very good headphone. Its sound quality is very good and quality material used to made this headphone.",5
"Hi,
All Amazon buyrs following Issues I found wuth some good features also.
First Good Features.This after 6 month of usage I am submitting this review.
1) Good Packaging
2) Amazon Delivery is fine.

Issues.
1) Bluetooth always gives poor quality sound when we use with Phone call. Person on other end did not get clear voice from us.
2) Battery time is not more then 15 Hrd.

Conclusion: I will always regret that insted of buying Sony Headphones who has a strong service center support I choose this China made product. Any way its a waste of money. Do not go for it.

"Price too much hiked for the value it is giving. Expected very much, but its nothing! Fuski bum hai ye to.

Cons:
1. Not comfortable for more >=1 hour even in the most stretched mode!
2. Bluetooth connectivity is as ordinary as a 100rs/- blue tooth stick which I bought long back.
3. Buttons feel cheaper. Dont this it will last long.
4. Microphone isn't very sensitive while talking on phone. My 380/- wired earphone is better in this area than this 3.5k headphone.
5. Blue tooth pairing with 2 or more devices is not really feasible. For this price they should have included this bit of technology in this headphone.
6. Sound quality is only as good as a 800/- headphone I bought lastly.

Pros:
1. Battery may really long last. It worked for appx 20 hours for me against their promise of 24 hours. Its still fine for me. But because of discomfort of wearing for long, dont know what use it will serve.
2. Jamming with the guitar in your headphone is quite a cool option.
3. We can use the 3.5 mm wires if the battery doesn't last long.
4. Also you can avoid blue tooth near around your body by simply using the 3.5 mm jack given.
5. If you like the Premium Gaana subscription, you might feel good for 3months free subscription it is giving in extra.

Last word - They have simply hiked the price without really covering all the aspects of such a costly headphone.
It is good buy only under 1500/-. Not a single rupee more than that!!
I would have given a 5 Star rating for that price, but really disappointed with the company's pricing strategy! Only a money making company. Not a value giving Company! Sorry for bitter truth üôèüèº",1
"THIS IS THE MOST DISAPPOINTING HEADPHONES I HAVE EVER PURCHASED. IT IS ABSOLUTELY USELESS IF YOU RECEIVE CALLS WHILE USING ON BLUETOOTH. THE CALLER CANNOT HEAR YOUR VOICE AT ALL. WHEN I RECEIVED THE HEADPHONES, I ASSUMED IT MUST BE DEFECTIVE. I ASKED FOR REFUND BUT WAS SENT REPLACEMENT HEADPHONES. EVEN WITH THE REPLACEMENT, THE SAME PROBLEM CONTINUES. IF YOU RECEIVE A VOICE CALL, THE CALLER WILL NOT BE ABLE TO HEAR YOU, WHILE YOU CAN HEAR THE CALLER. I CHECKED EVERYTHING IN BOTH THE HEADPHONES, EVEN SHOWED IT TO MY ELECTRONICS DEALER, BUT IT WAS OF NO USE. UNFORTUNATELY AMAZON DOES NOT HAVE REFUND POLICY FOR THIS PRODUCT. I HAVE WASTED MY MOENY & WILL NEVER BIY ANY ELECTRONICS ON AMAZON INDIA. AMAZON, IF YOU REALLY HAVE A CUSTOMER CARE SUPPORT, PLEASE GET ME A REFUND & REDEEM YOUR REPUTATION",1
"Extremely Poor Mic quality, the person on other side feels like your voice is just too heavy and not clear at all.

switching between PC and phone isn‚Äôt that great as well.

It switches to PC quick but not as quick to the phone.",1
"Pros:
- Nice looks
- Comfortable over the head and ear because of cushioning
- fits well, length can be adjusted. Fits nicely over the ears
- Got quick replacement which is working good now

Cons:
- Pricey for given set of features
- Bluetooth connectivity is limited range. My other over-the-ear headphone bought at 1/3 price provides long range and strong bluetooth connectivity than this
- Only volume and start/stop controls on the headset. My low end headphone provides next song / prev song controls too, along with pause
- Even though covers the ears, doesn't reduce noise much (not that they claim, but was my expectation)
- For the given price of INR 3400, more functionality could have been provided",3
"Had purchased a Fire Boltt 1400 headphone that was delivered by Amazon on 23 Sept 2020. Within two months of use the Bluetooth button ceased functioning. This was reported to the seller, who guided me to the manufacturer. I contacted the manufacturer's customer service through E-mail. As advised by them I was asked to provide all the details along with copy of the bill, a short video of the defective product & some other details like pick up address for replacement. The defective product was picked up by the company's courier service & I was assured of replacement within approximately 15 days upon receipt of the defective headphone at their warehouse. According to the tracking record of the courier service, Delhivery, the headphone was returned at the company's warehouse on 28 Dec. 2020. I am sorry to state that I have not received replacement of the headphone till now. I have sent four reminders to the company and shockingly the company is neither responding nor acknowledging my mails in this regard. I feel cheated & robbed of Rs.3499/-, the amount paid to Amazon for this headphone.
So please beware & be informed if you are planning to purchase a Boltt product.",1
By just browsing on the Boltt website for not more then 5 mins it was confirmed that I wanted to but the Boltt blast 1400. The Headphones fit comfortably over your Ears and not on your Ears which is a big plus point . You won't find any other Bluetooth headphone in this Range that fit Over ears. Connectivity of the headphones are rock solid did not have a Single drop in the connection no matter what. The treble and Bass is equally balanced . There is no Sound cancellation hardware in these headphones however the Ear Muffs on the Headphones seal the external sound Upto 50 %. The built Quality of the headphones is above Average or Close to Good but not GOOD and definitely not excellent. The Buttons are located in the right place easy to Operate. It has a 6.5 mm jack for audio sharing which is my favourite feature I connect the headphones to my Old Home theatre via Aux and play music wirelessly. The price of the product is definitely a Steal deal. The package includes a micro Usb 2.0 cable for charging and a 6.5 mm to 3.5mm aux cable for audio sharing .The headphones do have a Dedicated 3.5mm jack to listen to music if your headphones run out of power but no 3.5mm to 3.5mm audio cable included in the Box. The box also incly few coupons for free gaana.com for 3 month and coupons for movie tickets. Overall it the best Headphones on this price range .,5
"The product is okayish, more or less like anything else in the 2500-3000 rupees price range, won't go into technical details, once you bought the product you're on your own, if it works it works, if some problem arises, the one year warranty is nothing more than a scam, that's the problem with these disguised drop shipping companies, they only know how to import stuff and rebrand them with their own, the service is trash, the slider from both sides got loose and it no longer stays on the ears, been posted many times about all the details required on their website and mailed them 15 times and they said they don't cover it in the warranty, although, there's no physical breakage at all, I asked them about how and where to get it fixed as the slider design is not common, it's so annoying that first they give response after 10 mails and when they do, it's worthless it's okay even if it is paid repair, but they never responded afterwards. Better go for the top brands or independent companies if service is important to you.",1
"1)Build quality Excellent.
2) Bluetooth connectivity seamless.
3)Sound Quality, perfection to fall in love.
4)comfort ,hmm 10 min of usage and my ears feel very uncomfortable,might be it needs to be aged a bit.
Overall it's a good headset .
Above are my first impressions ,and used just for 10 min.",5
"Pros:
1. Very sturdy design
2. Long battery life
3. Good audio sound quality
4. Can connect another headset using Aux cable , so that same audio can be listed by two people at a time
5. Comforatable with long usage. Could use it comfortably for continuous calls for 2-3 hours.
6. Combination of wired and wireless gives added flexibiliy.

Cons:
1. Struggled to connect Webex on Widnows 10 laptop. The bluetooth mike does not work properly.
2. Multipoint functionality does not work the way I understood. As soon as I connect my mobile, I can't hear the ongoing audio on my laptop which was connected and playing earlier.
3. Many people complain to me that they can't hear me clearly on the call. I have to use my hands so that the voice gets directed to the mike.",4
"First off when you see the headphones, they look premium. The comfort of the ear pads is very good and it even fits big eared people like me (No pain on ears even after use for 4 hours plus).

The bluetooth range offered is also adequate, I could get the range for upto 20 feet, it was surprising as usually the headphones I owned before all could not provide such range.

After a week of usage, there have been some loose screws and they cannot be fitted back in place due to some manufacturing defect hence I cannot enjoy the music , I believe the return/replacement window should be atleast more than a week, you cannot judge the defects of a product within a week. Would have been glad if I could get a replacement.",3
"I bought this headset all hyped from the info, but my experience was very underwhelming. First, the microphone was not working at all. it was not able to capture my voice. I requested for replacement and that was done very quick so hats off to amazon's service. The replaced one had mic working but it isn't reliable at all.
its been a month of using it so here are my pros and cons.
Pros:
1. decent sound quality on bluetooth, gets better with headphone jack
2. kinda have microphone.
3. comfortable on ears.

Cons:
1. battery takes many hours to charge and doesnt last as long.
2. Sound on headphone jack is better than bluetooth.
3. Upon turning bluetooth on, stereo doesnt connect automatically, requires me to open bluetooth settings, disconnect, reconnect again and cross my fingers.",1
"Pathetic product from Boltt. Bought this to use to take calls using Zoom & Teams but it‚Äôs not working. Peanut can‚Äôt hear you as well as every few seconds disconnects. No noise cancellation.Even if fan is running people can only hear lots of noise.

In nutshell I would not suggest anyone to buy this if you wanted to use for taking calls. Buy it only when you just want to listen music. Even u can see delay in sync while seeing YouTube videos.",1
"TL; DR: Soft AND large ear-cups; medium-lightweight; good build quality; above-average music experience. Read further for a detailed review.

The main factor for me while looking for an over-ear headphone was that it actually has OVER ear ear-cups. And I should say that it definitely fulfils that job.

Pros:
1. The foam in the headband and ear-cups is very soft (for reference, as soft as a mushy banana) and has partial memory-foam, meaning it adjusts according to the contours of the ears.

2. The earcups are huge, dimensions (length/breadth of the oval): 10cm*8cm (outer); 6cm*4.5cm (inner).
2.1. They fully cover the ears, and one can keep wearing them for long without much discomfort.

3. The above ensures a good passive noise cancellation though (no ANC). Since it fully covers the ear, ~50% of the noise is cut down without music played, and ~75% while music is being played.

4. It has a well-built structure and good quality materials and leather used (haven't used for long but will probably last).

5. The headband has a metal strip running along, so it will remain sturdy.

6. It has good flexibility. It is highly portable, and at its smallest, the overall dimensions are less than 18cm*13cm.

7. The earcups can rotate along 2 axes, meaning they won't be vertically protruding when resting the headphones on the neck and shoulders.

8. They have both wired and wireless options to listen to songs, so not useless if the battery dies down.
8.1. The AUX cable provided (which is 6.3mm to 3.5mm jack) is 1 metre long (sufficient for moving around a bit)

9. Because they have 2 audio jacks, one can listen from 2 devices at the same time (for this, you will need an extra cable)
9.1. Alternatively, your friend/peer can connect their wired earphones/headphones on the extra jack and thus you both will be able to listen to the same movie/music at the SAME time, which is an AWESOME feature.

Cons:
1. It has a MicroUSB port, not a USB-C port (but the appropriate cable is provided in the pack so not big of a problem)

2. Sound quality is not the best in the market, but pretty good in the price range. Just that audiophiles might not find it up to the mark.

3. After a couple of hours, one might have to remove them to get some ventilation as the leather material doesn't let any air in, and might cause accumulation of heat.

4. It is mildly heavy, so after a while, one may initially feel the need to remove them for some time.

5. Maybe not appropriate to use while exercising, due to the same no-ventilation reason.

6. The controls (volume, play/pause) and microphone only function in wireless mode. When in wired mode, they are pretty much like any other headphone (not headset) in all types of utility.

7. Good quality plastic and leather is used, BUT I feel it might get worn easily. I will update this review after a little while of use.

So, guys, those were the honest feedbacks of my experience with these headphones. All I can say is the 4.2 ratings these have got are well-deserved and NOT a result of tacky business tactics like giving incentives for giving a good rating (like in the case of OneOdio).

They are definitely valued for money in this price range and will give you a bang for your buck‚Äîa premium experience at a fraction of the cost of other branded products.

If you're not an audiophile or music connoisseur who is looking for a top-class experience, I see no credible reason for you not to check these out.

Good luck out there. Cheers!",5
"Writing this Review after testing it for a Month and I'm amazed by it's Performance...

If you are planning to spend Rs.3000 on Headphones then I'll suggest you to go for Boltt Blast 140 Headphones an they are Over-Ear Headphones which has some great Sound Quality, Clarity and Deep Bass and one of the most important thing it has really Great Battery Life (20-25hrs).

Morever I only charged these Headphones twice in a Month and I've using it daily for about 2-3 Hrs ...

When I was purchasing these Headphones I was in doubt that only 9 people have bought them so far and price is also comparable to JBL and much higher than Budget Headphones king BOAT but when I took a risk and came to know that my risk was totally Worth and really Appreciate Team Bollt for these Wonderful Headphones...üíØüî•üëå",5
The first headphone had lots of crackling and distortion so a replacement was requested. The replacement arrived promptly but seemed like some one elses replacement piece or a refurbished one . All the inmer packing was open and box was externally taped. The distortion still exists so not only headphones are not upto the mark but seller also seems to be shady sending out a used piece as replacement for a faulty ouece.,1
Sound quality is very good . Excellent for listening to music . Below average while using for talking to people after connecting via Bluetooth to your Phone. People whom you are talking to complain they cannot hear you . No noice cancellation and you can also hear whom you are calling with difficulty. Listening to music on this is excellent,4
"Absolutely great product for listening purpose but not a great for calling or skype meeting microphone in this headphone below average and when you are talking over the phone or in meeting with this headphone the person at another end will feel that you are talking for a very long distance so, call quality is disappointing and many times it gives trouble to connect a microphone with skype calls.
Connectivity is great. fast connect and autodetect. sometimes I experience noise glitches in this headphone so, noise cancellation is so so.
In nutshell, if you are looking for an all-round product which will help you in calling, skype meetings, and binge-watching then, you should go for a higher range like Sony but not this. but if you are using this only for listening purpose then this product is value for money.",3
"Have been using the headphone for over a year now and I will rate it 4/5 for its price range. I purchased the black version of the headset and I have mainly used it with wires with little wireless testing.

Pros:
1. Very comfortable. I have a larger head than average. I also wear glasses so if your looking for a headset that's comfortable with glasses on, this is a good product

2. Battery lasts as long as advertised. No issue with bluetooth as well as battery life till now (I primarily use it wired though)

3. The bass is not the strongest but its there and its comfortable to listen to. If your not a heavy bass music enthusiast, then you wont go wrong with this headphone

4. Blocks some outside noise while listening to something, but when its silent you can hear everything. I dont listen to excessively loud noises or music while using my pc and yet I have missed out on conversations towards me at times due to noise cancellation/blocking. Noise Cancellation rating 3/5

5. The ear cushion material was much more sturdy than most headphones in this and lower price range. My ear cushions deteriorate very quickly usually due to sweating etc.

Cons:
1. Music quality is a bit lower when using bluetooth. I forgot the reason why but its best using wires

2. The headband is made of plastic which breaks in ~ 1 - 2months on high usage especially at the left/right rotating junction for both speakers. I had to stick mine with super glue to continue using it (no longer able to rotate the headphones left and right)",4
"It is like a bull worker on your head can‚Äôt bear it for 3 minutes one full music no. No great sound terrible mic. the package.This is old Tecnology junk that costs 3500/ my sons 1800 bucks head phones have fast charging every thing in it is better than this. I decided to return it with in 5 minutes of opening and called Amazon. These guys say their policy is only replacement. I tried to convince them for half an hour another 10 minutes with the hire up of Amazon just did not work. Beware these guys deliver junk With in 24 hours. Now I need space to store it.
All I am asking is replacement with another brand Amazon refused to do it. It is better to buy in a store to avoid this kind of Cheating.",1
"Well these Fire-Boltt Blast 1400 Over -Ear Bluetooth Wireless Headphones with 25H Playtime, Thumping Bass, Lightweight Foldable Compact Design with Google/Siri Voice Assistance are good enough to watch movies & listening normal music (normal music) because these headphones doesn‚Äôt support very Heavy Bass like (Sony MDR-XB450 On-Ear EXTRA BASS) Headphones have. Even they have HI-FI SOUND & CAPTIVATING BASS 40mm large-aperture drivers... then also the heavy bass Games, Music, & Movies doesn‚Äôt sound good.
Noise Cancellation is kind of okay not that great.
Bluetooth Connection is good enough.
Battery good on single charge & use of 6 Horus daily battery backup runs for almost 1-2 days without charging. But there is one problem too that as soon as battery level comes low at 30% the sharp beep sound starts. The quality of Aux Cable is not good.
All over these Fire-Boltt Blast 1400 headphones are good but not that great...!",4
" Bass is ok not too good..better than boat headphones coming below 2k..and in league with Skullcandy,jbl, sony headphone coming around 5k..

Aux cable 3.5mm to 6.5 mm jack..
little bit squeaky sound with base but can't find its solution under 6-7k..
Worth for the money compared to other headphones..but should be under 2k..
Bluetooth range is good ..worked in whole house for me..

CONS-
Mike doesn't works when using with laptop for Google meet, skype teams, - either use laptop Mike with it or aux cable..
Ear pad will cause little heat due to close insulation but bearable..",3
"Fire-Boltt Blast 1400
Giving this review as Boltt company has made it mandatory to register the warranty online.
Forcing customers to give review is so ridiculous.

Actual review will be updated soon.",4
"1. Its very tight, specially those who wears glasses it is extremely uncomfortable to use it for more than 20-30 mins.
2. Sound is low compared to other (Sony, Phillips) headphones.
3. The charging or other status notification light is quite poor (location as well as visibility)
4. Bluetooth connectivity takes a longtime and also frequently disconnects. I am using iphone & mac to connect - airpods work perfectly fine with the same setup. I also had a bose bluetooth earphones which also used to connect instantly & didn't disconnect.

Overall pretty bad product.",2
" After reading few reviews and a discount on this product felt that I was cheated.
Used this item and here is my feedback.
Pros: None

Cons: Sound quality is below average.
For phone Calling Mike is just OK.
Noise cancelation doesn't work.
People sitting nearby can hear whatever you are playing like loud speaker.
Durability is also a question and need to watch out for.

Many other well known brands offer better sound quality and weighs lighter than this Boltt.
So conclusion: Just avoid it and go for a better one at the same price",1
"I have included the email screenshot. PLEASE READ THE FULL REVIEW
Do NOT NOT NOT NOT buy give your money to someone if you have extra (SERIOUSLY).
Amazon should include negative star rating
Using this product for the past 9 months.

Woking Fine for 1.5 months
after that left ear peace suddenly got loose.
After that Bluetooth started to flicker.
After that Suddenly only one side was working.

1. it was working fine for the first 1.5 months after that .....
2. after 1.5 months - the left ear peace suddenly got loose it bothered me and then I thought maybe I sit on it or something.
3. after 3 months -Bluetooth started to flicker I thought it's OK also it didn't matter for me as I was using it with wire.
4. after 4.5 months - Suddenly only one side was working with the wire attached. And I started looking for claiming process.

I applied for the warranty and filled the form they asked me for some pictures and papers which I gave the same day. From then whenever I mail for the updates they say....
""We have received your complaint successfully & our technical team shall get back to you soon on this.""
After 1.5 months of claiming and rigorous mailing from my side they said ""The video you uploaded is not proper."" So I uploaded the another one.
and again it's been a month since that.
We have exchanged more than 30 mails and the process has gone nowhere.
They haven't answered my question when i say what would happen if my warranty got over during this period.
It's been more than 2.5 months.",1
"I have been using the Fire-Boltt Blast 1400 Over-Ear Bluetooth Wireless Headphone for quite some time now and I gotta say, I‚Äôm really impressed. At first, I was confused about whether to buy it or not. After doing some research, I ended up buying this Boltt headphone. I would like to mention some pros and cons of the product for a better understanding.

Pros:

1) The Boltt headphone has a premium feel to it. It isn‚Äôt heavy at all and places like a charm over the ears. I use it especially for a long time while I am gaming and editing. I love it when it feels so light over the ears and makes me wonder I can wear this 24hrs straight. The foam padding on both sides is so soft that it never hurts my ears even when I am wearing this for a long time.

2) I‚Äôm impressed by the noise cancellation effect. When I am gaming or listening to music, I don‚Äôt hear any unwanted noise from the background. This way I can concentrate on my work even more. The sound quality is also great and the bass is just amazing.

3) The three buttons on the headphones for volume control, Bluetooth connectivity, and changing music tracks come in handy.

4) I especially love the music-sharing feature provided with these headphones. The DJ 6.35mm port is absolutely killing it when it comes to this feature.

Cons:

1) I don‚Äôt know if I am the only one who is experiencing this or not but I feel that the sound quality seems to be better when I plug the headphones into a device. Maybe it happens because of the audio drivers present in the device. The only fact is the audio quality seems a little inferior when it is in wireless mode.

2) The music-sharing feature is only possible via the 6.35mm port. It should have been available with the 3.5mm aux port as well.

3) The microphone isn‚Äôt that good because it records the background noises.

Overall, if you ask me then I‚Äôll say that I am really satisfied with Fire-Boltt Blast 1400 Over-Ear Bluetooth Wireless Headphone. It‚Äôs absolutely a killer in this budget. I would highly recommend others to buy this if you plan to do some gaming and other workstation stuff.",4
"I WAS BIT CONCERN ABOUT THE BUILT AND SOUND QUALITY, BUT AFTER REVIEWING THE REVIEWS I BOUGHT THESE PAIR OF HEADPHONES.

BUT WITH PLEASANT SURPRISE ON THE FIRST SONG I LIKED IT VERY MUCH.

GREAT TREBLE, MID RANGE AND GREATER LOWER BASS BEATS, THOUGH HIGH BASS IS NOT CLEAR AND WILL DISAPPOINTS HIGH BASS LOVER.

EAR CUPS FITS LARGE EARS WITH EASE, BUT IT IS BIT TO HEAVY DUE TO STRONG METAL HINGES.

BUILT QUALITY IS VERY VERY PREMIUM AND PLEASING TO EYES.

I WAS USING BLAUPUNKT BH-21 BEFORE THIS, AND THESE ARE FAR BETTER THEN BLAUPUNKT BH-21.",5
"I was sceptical of choosing this headset based on some bad reviews. And was thinking may be I should go with Sony. But unexpectedly this exceed my expectations.
Build quality is good.
Sound quality is good. It doesn't give that huge unnecessary base. Crisp sound, can hear details of song.
Cushion are very soft and can use for hours.
However if you are late-night watcher, then you won't find it comfortable lying down on your bed. The headset is huge in size. Turning head on pillow while watching will be uncomfortable. But hey, you should not watch movies lying down. Not good for health. üòé
Noise cancellation is not active but its not that bad.
Blue tooth range is good.
Buttons are not difficult. You just have get used to of it.",5
"Bluetooth connectivity has some issue. I can connect to my mobile and laptop well, but with MI TV even if it connected, but sound is too much disturbed all time.

Plastic quality is not that much good. But comfortable while using. U can use wired connected also. Mike also working properly.

Update after 2 months
--------------------------
Most of the time it's mike doesn't work properly. You can't use it for attending any online meeting. Just for hearing music is ok. After two months use the connectivity issues increased. So.. i never recommend this product.",1
"This is truly a revolutionary product. The sound quality is unmatched and has been set keeping the millenials in mind. The best part of the product is its cushion on the side that doesn't let you feel pain even after using it for long hours. The second best thing is its battery, it doesn't really get over. I have been using it for almost 3 days now and at a moment I got bored but the nattery didn't die.

Also, unlike other products, there are no heavy lights on the sides which gives it a premium touch and can be used during your travel very well without disturbing your co passenger!

In a nutshell, it is worth buying and can justify your expenditure as well.",4
"This is quite a bad product for the price. Besides, the seller is not even bothered to package it properly. When it arrived, the cardboard boxes were clearly opened and even torn. I've attached images just after opening. It came in a terrible condition.

The product is also bad. The bluetooth doesn't even connect properly to the TV. I finally succeeded in connecting it and the connection suffers once you're more than 4 feet from the TV. (The TV is an LG 55 inch in excellent condition). The sound quality is also poor. I don't understand all the rave reviews here for this poor product.",1
"Manufacturer: Fire-Boltt Model: BH1400

Ordered on 19 January 2021 Delivered on 19 January 2021

The overall product and build quality are Very sturdy and with adjustable headband, foldable ear cups, and Comfortable cloud-soft protein ear pads, the sound quality is good and it as Bluetooth BT5.0+ with indicator it connects with Android and iPhone with not problem it has a very good range. The In-Built Mic is good it has a power on/off switch volume controller, it can be used in both modes wireless and dual duty (3.5 mm & 6.3mm) cable and port with descent battery life Micro USB. Absolute value for money. I recommend this product. Will update if any in feature.",4
"Purchased this product on 21-May-2020. Overall good quality product. It nicely fits over the ears. Once the sound is playing then you hear little outside noise.

The headphones were completely charged on arrival. The connectivity with iOS devices is excellent. I connected them with iPhone, iPad and MacBook. Connection worked flawlessly in first place.

Good value for money.",5
"Ordered in under prime day offer and posting review prime day sale ends!!! Go for it, initial impression is awesome for me. Working well for my Teams calls over Bluetooth, Connects well over Bluetooth of my Amazon Firestick. Picks up signals till 25ft with two walls, then starts breaking.. Drained 50% after a day and half of regular usage..
Pros: Build quality is fine, Good balanced bass even at higher volumes, Picks up lows and mid very well, Noise isolation is good in this price range, fits perfectly on the ears. Should work well for gamers as it picks up finest of sounds very well.
Cons: Little weighty, at least I felt that. Starts after a pause of 3-4 secs upon long press, it irritates a bit to me, could have been faster..",5
"After going through so many brands and reviews for so many days, decided to give it a chance because I wanted worth of my money and believe me, I didn't regret a bit after it's performance and recommended to all. Crisp sound quality, not too much of bass nor too flat, just right for your ears, btw I like my music loud but this headphones I had to decrease the volume. It's just amazing. Battery power is just too good. I am not a heavy user but it's more than a month I charged n still working fine. Mic quality is good. Ear pads are very soft and doesn't hurt ear but it creates a little vaccum cos it's a snug fit so time to time, u May have to release. All n all it's an amazing buy. Highly recommend.",4
"Headphone build quality is good. Light weight and very Comfortable to wear for long time. Easy to connect and sound quality is excellent.
Only con is when connected to laptop through bluetooth, mic is not working.

Update:
After 4 days of usage,
1. YouTube audio is cracking, cross checked with my old headphone.. no problem with that.
2. Cannot use this headphone for Calls. Mic is really low, people on other side of the calls not able to hear me. Fire Boltt should atleast provide aux cable with mic.
3. Connectivity is getting degraded, 1st n 2nd day no problem, but on 3rd day onwards ""kaarrr"" sound coming even when my phone is placed in front of me.

So downgraded rating to 2stars n returned the headphone.",2
"Dint want to spend too much on the likes of JBL AKG Bose or others...love the sound...no piercing treble no blaring bass...seems like a pretty balanced headphone with adequate noise cancellation for phone calls / music and you could always hit the Equalizer for custom audio...Loved it!
Adequate padding that is really soft and that DOES NOT press on the top of the ear, hence no pain, especially for people with glasses this is a blessing...not to nit pic but it's a given if you sitting without any ac for prolonged periods they tend to get just a little sweaty but much better than the annoying on ear headphones...

Bluetooth, aux makes sure with or without battery you'll be able to use them hassle free...Watched 4 movies since I got them and haven't charged them once so I guess the battery is going good too!!",5
This is very bad product in this range . Upper features does not match as shown in the description. In this product noise cancellation problem is very high . When I am connecting my headphones to my laptop and using internet in my laptop seeing videos & listening üéß the music üéµthen my headphone disturb the voice of online videos and music.please listen the voice of customer and I have no customer support and I call the customer care but no response for me. And many issues my headphone such ex I'm listening the music then suddenly between the music beep sound and beep sound is irritating when I listening the song. So I request please doy buy this product. I boycott this company,1
"It stopped working within a month or so, moderate usage. Don't know if it software drivers issue. Some videos on YouTube and others work some give a weird sound or no sound at all. It is gathering dust. Don't know how and where to go to fix it without wasting much time. The Voice in a video is becoming like a ghost voice, but the background music is audible.",1
"5 months usage update - microphone stopped working and with the ultimate careful usage the speaker seems to be shaken.. product is good but the quality and reliability is not so good for the money .. I could have gone for a skull candy which was reliable for more than 2 years ..

after these many months usage even the battery seems to drain faster than the initial time period ..

.. using it for straight 9hrs of my working hours and I charge it three days once .. mainly using to connect with my mi4k audio while connecting to Bluetooth audio video lags on 4K and by aux audio is extremely low .. not sure if it‚Äôs Bluetooth issue or the mi4k tv issue.. hope I figure that out sooner ..",1
"So much problem with connectivity, bluetooth lags a lot, its more than 2sec dealy in audio on bluetooth mode .
and wort part its wired connection is never stable have tried with multiple devices its same never got clear audio in one go . with this price i was expecting good headphone but soy i have to say 500rs headphone is way better than this.",1
"Jabardast...
When you use Bluetooth and listen music, you will feel nice sound its good. You will be satisfied.
When you use cable and add effects of equiliser from mobile- You will have feeling of more than satisfaction.
I think these comments will be enough for your selection and review. I not technical guy. So, I don't have that deep knowledge.

I have only one disappointment that user manual should be batter, how much duration we need to charge, how we will know its fully charged, these questions should be added there.",5
"Great headphones; comfortable and pair easily. The only downside is there is no pre-warning when the battery charge is running low. So in the middle of the night, sleeping to binaural beats, it starts loud beeping. Just something to be time managed. Three stars for noise cancellation because I can easily hear outside noises, but I don't think that's a touted feature anyways. Not a big problem for me. I would buy again.",5
"I‚Äôm writing this review after almost 6 months of daily usage.

First of all the design is very simple, looks premium and very convenient. Ear cups can be folded inwards and can also can be rotated about 90 degree towards one side; which is not very common feature in this price range. This allows comfortably positioning the cups over the ear.

The material quality is very good with respect to the price. Headphone feels very robust while handling.

The ear cups are adequate in size (5.5cm by 4.5cm inside) and cover the entire ear unless one have very large ears. The pads are very soft and comfortable and have not deformed or cracked till now.

The pressure applied by the head band is slightly on the higher side, but not to the point of hurting the ears. One will get used to it in a short while.

Bluetooth function is straight forward and easy to use. Gives several hours of playback time, but I have not tested full battery backup duration. In built battery can be charged with any standard phone charger (usb-c; not provided in the box).

The Mic is positioned in one of the ear cups and works fine in Bluetooth mode. In wired mode a ‚Äò3.5 mm, 4 pole aux cable‚Äô is needed for it to function (not provided in the box).

The cable provided in the pack is 3.5mm-6.35mm (male), 3 pole, and 1 meter. Unlike the headphone, the cable is not suitable for rough handling (1 star less). Mine got bend and defective in about four months time. But any 3.5mm aux cable (3 pole also, without mic) will work fine.

The head phone have both 3.5mm and 6.35mm jack input provision, one on each side. This provision allows another headphone to be connected in this and both play same audio (wired mode only); which I think is a very useful feature than we think.

Finally about Sound Quality:
Headphone has high bass response and believe me this is very good for listening almost everything. I used to have Beats headphone some time back and the sound signature feels almost similar. But I won‚Äôt recommend this being used for studio works as the bass muffles some of the higher frequencies.

So unless you are an audiophile, this is a bang for the buck headphone.",4
"This product has the ABSOLUTE WORST microphone quality.
Please don't buy it for calls. It's very good in terms if build quality and decent music output.
I exchanged it once and returned it the next time for a refund.
Please don't go buy the amazing 4.5+ reviews, I fell for it too.",1
"Well, i usually explore new brands and new gadgets. If u want to c video. Refers BadBoysClub youtube channel.
Review;
Well i was using ant audio from past 2years and it was very good and had set an good benchmark for all other headphones like boat leaf etc.. But this just blown my mind. Clear audio with clean base. Mic is good. Connectivity is good and complete audio experience is great. Very light weight. Nice looks nice range nice audio clarity. Crystal clear audio. If ur budget is 2.5k then i suggest to buy it. If cost is more then 3k better of with other headsets. Under 2.5k best audio exp.
At the end buy wt your heart says.

With medium volume. Surrounding noices can not be heard. Noise is very well insulated",5
"Sound quality not expected level for this price rs.3000.mic is not clear. Not recommend to use more than 1 hrs,bcoz it's cover ur full hear sweating coming. Usb charging cable length low so u have to use mobile charge cable . I'm fully not satisfied very disappointed..I not recommend this product to buy this price .",3
"Okay so.. I'm writing this review after 2 months of use okay.. Umm.. What i've experienced.. Is mostly regret.. i'll really recommend you.. Don't buy these.. First of all.. There is no good noise cancelling.. Riddim tracks trap music.. These all are meant to to played at high voulmes.. But these headphones don't do justice at all.. The audio start to crack up a bit.. And that gets really annoying.. The mic.. Omg.. This mic is like.. Not that good at all.. Considering that you are paying 3500 for these.. The overall experience is not like bad or something.. But yiu won't feel satisfied buying these.. These are good headphones.. No complain about that.. But these would be good if they were priced at aroung 1500 bucks.. I'd rather recommend you buy-
1. Cosair HS45
2. HyperX cloud Stinger
3. Razer Kraken(this is available at Flipcart though)
4. One Odio( the mid prcied one)
5. Corsair HS35 Stereo Gaming headphones

All these are a bit more priced than 3500.. Like around 4000 or so.. But trust me won't regrey buying these.. All the headphones that i mentioned are like an one time investment and beasts at performance..",3
"A sturdy product but with a lot of defects.
Pros -:
Cushioning is good on earcups and headband.
Good built
Cons -:
Poor bluetooth connectivity
Average sound quality.
Battery drains very quickly
Heavy
Not portable
Note -: There is a constant buzzing sound in one of the earcups and that isn't bearable.
I don't recommend buying this.
Worst experience.
Instead increase your budget a little and buy a good company headphones",2
"These are the same as the oneodio, claw and a couple more companies who have the same drivers or buy the sound drivers from the same manufacturer. I own the oneodio headphones as well and they more or less sound the same, and that is a good thing because they have never disappointed me in terms of sound delivery.

They are more comfortable than the other headphones in this prize range and the sound chip for the bluetooth is working as intended. It's nothing special but it gets the job done and the drivers are sure to last in the long run. From the other reviews I feel the batteries and sound quality will last longer too. Will edit the review after long usage as well, I am leaving a review now because there is a review reward system which I am checking out to see if they are compensating for something, which they are not for the moment..

The packaging could be a bit better with a coiled cable but other than that, I think this is worth buying.",4
"First of all my review is unbiased since I already have spotify and youtube music subscription, So I basically don't require gaana subscription.And also I would compare it with boat 510 as I think it is the popular choice among 2k price range.
Design- Its extremely well made for the price and doesn't feel like cheap plastic unlike 510 and is extremely comfortableto use.
Bluetooth connectivity- No problem at all.Bluetooth 5.0 comes in handy.No problem with range either.
Battery-Too good.Been using for 3hrs for a week.Still has like 20% left.

Sound-Now the most important part.If you like base go for 510 it has better base than this.But it has better mids and it has handled treble better.It is ofcourse not a very well balanced headphone and we won't get at this price but it has sufficient base needed for song.For example 510 has got terrible mids and is painful to ears but it doesn't have any of those problems.And it is loud enough and I don't think anyone will have any problem.

Verdict-If you are looking for a good balanced wireless headphone in this range then I think it is the best product you can invest because I haven't seen any other product which is better.",5
Not very comfortable ..too heavy...sound is okay..i think reviews were hyped up and not a premium class...its okay..not highly recommended..price is costly as compared to other in range of appx1.5 k to 2k. Quality is same and wieghy,3
"I used this for a week and returned the product as the Microphone was not upto the mark. I couldnt use this for voice calls. In the one week, I had the device, I observed very good audio output and that is something I wanted to call out. But if you are looking for this one for voice calls, then better consider something else. Another point was that, I felt the headphone to be a bit heavy.",3
"I am an avid music lover.. I own many in ear earphones like the wired Sennheiser Cx275S & Bose truly wireless earpods which cost me around 19K.. For years I have been searching for Over-the-ear wireless Bluetooth headphones.. I'd purchased a Sennheiser but wasn't satisfied so returned it back.. Then tried a cheap company called Skyfly only ending up with regrets. After a lot of search, I took a risk & purchased this Fire Boltt 1400 just for Rs.3000/.

I just can't believe my ears after listening music in this.. Either in Bluetooth mode or wired both.. The audio quality is crystal clear and is on par with high end headphones which costs more than 20,000/. Even the minute details are reproduced well.. The guitar strumming, the violin strings, the drum cymbals & vocals ofcourse everything sounded so rich.. The sound staging was fantastic.. The sound signature is designed to produce rich clean music with decent bass.. So for music lovers who are not bassheads, this headphone is hugely recommended..

But wait..!! This magic headphone has another hidden beast mode.. It can also act as a complete bass heavy headphone which will vibrate your ears..!! I own Redmi note 7 pro mobile.. Believe me the only reason I buy Redmi mobiles is because it has one of the best audio chipset.. The audio signal from it will be fantastic.. And there is this crazy app called MusixMatch.. Turn the 3D Effect to 70% & Bass Boost to 100% in it.. Now play 'Malhari' song with some 75% volume.. Your ears will literally vibrate.. I just can't believe this headphone is capable of doing this..!! Ofcourse it cannot reproduce ultra low bass below 20Hz like in 2nd interlude of 'Chaiya Chaiya' song but it's okay for this price range.. I tested it's frequency response and it starts from 25Hz - 16KHz.. My ears can't hear more than 16KHz.. It has Sound Pressure Level of 110db which is huuuge.. I am really amazed & satisfied with my purchase.. I'd listened music for 2 hours continuously & didn't feel any irritation thanks to its soft cushion.. I think this startup company should be encouraged.. I will keep using this for couple of months & then give updates if I find any issues..",5
"I liked the feel on the ears and the head. It is comfortable to wear and use even for periods of time. It is a sturdy and well-made device. The sound quality is good (as in my hearing the other parties on the call, whether phone calls or Internet calls). However, other parties on both these types of call often complain that my voice can't be heard (because of low volume of my voice). This is despite my adjusting the volume controls and rotating the device over my head for improving mic voice detection and my speaking louder. I therefore think that the wireless mic is weak on voice detection.",4
"I got it in 2.5k during sale. I was thinking i should have ordered something branded by putting more money. When it got delivered. Later when I started using it I am completely in love with this. Everything is fine and superb. I highly recommend and you can blindly go for it. I have also Tribit Wireless Bluetooth Headphones Over Ear which is 3.7k before this.
Once I got this boltt I stopped using Tribit. the only problem is since cushion are very soft and also noise isolated so little sweat comes after some hours. This review I am writing after using it for 5months. Seller has not given any coupons or cashback to write this review. This is honest review.",5
"used for a day only, however, I felt good about the product.
- Good cushioning .
- easy connecting to devices.
- great bass.
- I thought that the mic would work if I use a 3.5mm jack, but that is not the case.

Overall good experience till now.
I Will update if there are any changes to the experience.

An update: reduced one star because of non-responsiveness from support, my request is not yet acknowledged from the support.",3
The product is too bulky size. We don't like to wear for lonv hours. It does not connect with My laptop and T V. I am fed up. Using it with all products ia not possible. It connects only with my mobile that to after waiting for 2 min for connecting. My money is wasted. Trying to get warranty.,1
"Not the best device for noise cancellation.
Bluetooth connectivity and sound quality are good.
Sound is clear and feels nice to listen to music and movies.

Battery life is decent and last good 3-4 days even after heavy usage. With averge use it can last upto a week.

Padding and cushioning is good and makes the headphones feel light and easy to carry for longer duration. Won't say that they fit snugly on ear (probably because my ear are a bit big).

All in all, would recommend these earphones especially if you are confused and don't know what to buy.",5
"Everything good about this....
....this is not a noise cancelling headphones... Please dont get fooled.
..if you are looking for some premium in the range of 40$ ,nothing could outdo this.period.
...only drawback is that passive noise cancellation is very poor,.. But good for comfort factor..... You can wear this for days, without getting headache, something bose could never achieve.....
...i told you everything.... Please this are not travel type..cant block ambient sounds of classrooms, drill, aeroplane, ship, trains,traffic,etc...but excellent comfy....",4
"Amazing headphone, Excellent quality, Great sound, Bass is adequately loud you can feel the vibration on your ears, if you are looking for thumping bass it will go for you, Vocals are clear and you and even hear every single detail in the song and the best of it,s battery backup. Build quality is great and these headphones are quite comfortable. And you get 3.5mm jack and 6.5mm jack on it. Perfect for music lovers and gamers.l strongly recommend this product.",5
"An incredible product at this price segment.

The earcups are really soft and comfortable to wear for long hours, you might need a hardcase cover for keeping this precious.

The sound quality is good, which is quite obvious that aux will play good sound over Bluetooth.

Even with Bluetooth it is quite great, noise cancellation is great. I didn‚Äôt expect that something at this price point can be this brilliant.

There are 2 aux ports and a number of goodies, you get 3 months gaana+ subscription.",5
"This is the best purchase I have made on Amazon.
Brilliant.
Superb sound integrity.
3.5mm, 6.5mm, usb... wow, vaersatality.
The feel... wow. Simply superb.
Premium finish. Bunny soft ear pads. Sits so gently over the ears.
Even the cable insulation is so soft.
The packaging is another lever.
Especially the tamper proof cable box.
A wonderful product.",5
"Very sorry to say but support service of this product is ZERO... Yes if anything goes wrong with this product you don't have any service Center where they can fix this product.. Keep in Mind that... I am one of the victim and ready to pay to get fix this product but still non of the BOLTT Team turned over after several emails or calls.

Very bad experience.....",1
"Here is the honest review:-
1. Product quality is not awesome but good in this budget.
2. The sound quality is also good but not as expected.
3. Noise cancellation could have been better.
4. Audio jacks provided for both 3.5 and 6.3 so I impressed with this feature.
5. Comfortable but not for long hours, your ears might get started uncomfortable.
6. Light wait and quick charge and moreover music play hours also satisfactory.
7. Mic is available but voice quality is not great you may feel a bit of disappointment.

Overall this is a good headphone in this budget and meet all the expectations under it's categories.

" They are good, just a bit heavy I felt maybe this my first time using over the head headphones. Best part is it connects easily, battery life is excellent, and while working out it doesn't fall off my head. Sounds quality is decent. It also folds well. If you use it for office work like calls it will pick up background noise also. Rest this is good product if you want to by over the head headphones.",4
"I am a senior Citizen, very passionate about music. Bought this Headset after an evaluation of various other brands, unfortunately, just after few months it stopped working, though it connects via Bluetooth, there is no sound coming from the headset,had escalated the complaint to the support team, who called me a bit late.
Understand due pandemic working on skeleton staff, understandable, have given me an option to replace or even a refund, I will take the Latter and opt for the refund hopefully. Furthermore, I feel this headset is for the younger generation since it pumps in a Rocking Bass, which is rather too heavy for an old man I guess so. Product-wise its a good head set robustly built.",4
"This product is very comfortable to use as it has a larger over the earpads which give a little extra space to your ears and also enable a longer duration use without any discomfort.
The sound quality and overall aspects of sound are also great.

Improvements required:
sound clarity can be enhanced
This product comes along with - 1) 3.5mm male to 6.35mm male cable and 2) micro USB cable. A 3.5mm double-sided male AUX cable should also be provided OR A good quality 6.35mm female to 3.5mm male converter should be provided.
Noise Cancellation needs to be improved.",5

"I have been using it for months and from the previous headphones I have been using around this price, this truly is a pleasure to my ears and even though you can't just compare it will the big guys, this truly is worth the money and about the features you would have already read. The battery life is absolutely amazing lasting upto 4 days with moderate usage and sound quality is above sub-par. Thank you for reading.",4
"Below expectations sounds muddy but ensure that thumpy bass along with vibration, it depends on volume above it tends to distort and sound start throttling and beg for mercy.

Below mentioned score will justify the Headphones
Bass : 4/5
Treble : 2/5
High : 2.5/5
Low : 3/5
Battery Backup : 4.5/5

In my usage i found this to be average and quite surprised with bass",3
"Its giving me crackling sound when connected to fire stick. Rest the wuality is good. But it seems this is a bug in the headphones. My all other bluetooth devices connect well without any issues. Can someone please help in fixing the issue?
I dont want to return this if this can be fixed by a simple update.",1
"Sound LAG found while using with mobile (samsung galaxy Note-9, Samsung galaxy S20 plus and Redmi note5 pro).... 1-2 seconds straight lag even with the videos and games... and found 0.5 second pause sometimes specially when i play at 80% volume.... if possible plz fix this issue with the update.

Rest all is good sound and quality is good at this price range.",4
"I am writing this after 4 hours of continuous usage.
Likes:
1. Better sound quality
2. Excellent bass. Treble on the high and lows aren't great but not bad either
3. Pairs and connects in few seconds
4. Wired connection is better than wireless by all means. No complaints about the quality of cable
5. Call quality is good and neat

Dislikes:
1. After 30-45 minutes, discomfort starts on ears. Bearable for another 15 minutes
2. I really doubt it could give me 20 hours on Bluetooth mode. Yet to test it completely
3. A 3.5 to 3.5 AUX cable would have added more flexibility with other devices as well

Not too much complaints for 2999. A verified and happy buyer of FireBoltt.",4
"Superb headphones with plenty of ear comfort with those ginormous soft padded ear cups and amazing sound quality with crisp mids and perfectly balanced bass. A steal for the price they are being sold at. Not to mention they are a head turner no matter where you wear them. Battery life's fantastic as well, in short not much to complain about.

Just one thing though, the low battery sound indication starts coming on when the earphones are connected via Bluetooth and the battery is at 30% and this sound just doesn't go away. I wonder if anyone else is facing this issue. Would love to know the solution to this.",4
The headphones have good sound quality but very very cheap build quality it has been only 2 months and the left side of the headphones has become so loose that do not properly fit. Boltt has the worst customer service they took almost 1 months for warranty claim and I had to send almost 40+ mails to them and they just repaired the device and shipped it to me in a normal box but i was told that I will get a replacement and after that i tried to contact them but none of the mails were replied absolute waste of money,1
Bought it on 27 may 2020 and writing a review on 8 march 2021 still working like a fine wine. Spent 3000/- inr and i think with that price tag the product is quite nice. Loved the quality of the product and the sound quality is also very nice. Noice cancellation works perfectly. The only thing which bothers me is while on call you need to be a little louder as the other person sometimes complaints about not hearing you properly. But still it was a great purchase.,4
" Good Design
Great sound
Good bluetooth connectivity
Battery backup is really good
Comfort 4.5 star üëç
Light weight in spite of bigger size
Covrrd the ear nicely
Cons: The only con is after 40% of battery life, it will remind you in the form of beep for charging it every minutes. It's annoying. I don't know how to deal it?",5
"Good connectivity and long lasting battery. But takes time to getting used to, as ears pain initially.

Edit : writing this after 6months of usage. The hinges break off because of plastic used and now sit uncomfortably, almost unable to use as seen in the picture. No matter how carefully use it, but warranty wont cover it. I used black electric tape to them in place.",1
"Good Bluetooth headphone. It's very comfortable with soft padding.
The connectivity is great, it justifies the Bluetooth 5.0 tag.
The pairing is super quick and connectivity is super stable and the range is alright in the open area but when going from one room to another, the audio gets a little disturbed. Now that's alright for me.
The best thing about these is the audio sharing feature. If your TV or Android box can support only one Bluetooth headset at a time, with the 6.5 mm audio cable option you can share audio to any other wired headphones you have.
It also has a separate 3.5 mm slot if the battery runs out, and sound is just as good as in the wireless mode.
It's battery life is good. In my case, it lasted more than 26 hours at a stretch.
.
Just one thing that could be better is the microphone, it adds a lots of surround noise during a call, the other person can even hear the sound of wind, i think its because of the position of the microphone. Other than that its a great product.
.
Satisfied with the Product. Thank you Boltt. And for the fellow Readers, YES u can easily play PUBG with these ON. u just need to have bluetooth 5.0 or higer version in your phones.",4
"Used these over the ear headphones for one day after receiving. My first impression after using is value for money product in this price bracket. The sound quality is clear with distinct low, mid & high frequency output. I have only tested on 128 & 320 kbps mp3 files. Using CD quality files may give a better sound output.
Connectivity is very good with both phone & PC. Though I noticed a lag while playing Youtube videos. Also, in some angles, there seems to be some interference with 2.4Ghz wifi frequency.
The ear pads are soft and covers the full ear, but not much of passive noise cancellation.
Overall, I am impressed with the product and enjoying using it so far.",5
"Sound quality is good but the cushion
Is not soo good...
Connectivity is also really good...
But after few months of use...
Some part inside the headphone has started making noise...
Also joint of me headphone broke it didn't even fell down once! And still it's broken really disappointed! üôÅ
because of that join it's really uncomfortable to wear!!!",3
"Its very nice quality headphones with some awesome bass, I had read some bad reviews but still decided to buy this, and so far I have not been disappointed. Definitely recommended if these are ur first headphones.just 2 Cons are that if u plug the headphones using aux cable then mic does not work and u will be using ur devices mic(which is fine for me) and there is a beep every 30 seconds when battery falls below 15%. Also these are over ear headphones and are very comfortable for long use.u will take at least a day to get used to them, and after that they will be perfect.pls go for over ear headphones only instead of on ear headphones as on ear headphones will pain ur ears. If u are a hardcore audio phile and are OK to give up the convenience of Bluetooth then go for oneodio headphones,but they are not portable at all.so keep that in mind. The noise cancelation is better than average and there is no sound leakage and call quality is awesome. Latency of 150-180 ms is there for Bluetooth but will be fine if used with BT 5.0 devices or if used in wired mode if u are going for gaming.bluetooth connectivity is a+ and very good sound quality.",5
Headphones are very good. Passive noise cancellation is excellent. Cushion is very soft. Can be used continuously for long hours without any discomfort even when wearing specs. Bluetooth connectivity and sound quality is also excellent. One point which could have been better is that the extension plate could have been little longer as it fits little tight to my head.,4
"This headphones Bolt blast 1400, is really a great headphones if you're looking for very good and comforting music I've used this for just 3 days and I am so happy with this the build quality is really great and the sound quality is also very good but I think if it had a little more volume it would have been just great out of the world I found the volume little low for me, otherwise it's a beast the battery is really good no doubt can just go ahead and buy blindly if you are a bass music lover the music of the and the sound doesn't deteriorate even at high volume it is very pleasant to listen to music and watch movies at high volume also and you can keep on wearing them only thing is if you wear for too long my ears kind of sweat that is due to the humidity what we have here nothing else really great headphone just go for it",5
"The mic was not working, i had to replace it. Now got a product which was already opened and looked like a defective piece sent to me.

Complete unprofessional seller. Reported to amazon and returned the item.

This is not worth it guys.",1
"Product looks good

Performance looks good, sound is nice base is not too thumpy.
Bluetooth connectivity is good. Infact the sound is way better when connected to blue tooth than via cable.
It comes with memory foam ear cups which are soft in nature and provide good support to the ears when used for a long time.",4
"It's just cheap quality headphones not even worth more than 500rs, it's only suitable for heavy beat bass lovers. First time I'm facing all the issues mentioned by other users. Inner parts are not attached properly whenever I move head i get very parts moving sound. In normal song the background music are overlapping and the song look like some one talking behind.
And I'm sure the durability will be very less, it won't last after 5-6 months if used regularly.
Thanks amazon for getting return this product.",1
"I generally don't give product reviews that often. But this product really impressed me with its light weight and super sound quality. In this sale season I tried and returned some head phones and this seems to be the winner among those due to following:
1. light weight
2. snug fit and good sound isolation.
3. super sound quality.
4. never had any connectivity issues
5 Battery life seems to be good.

cons:
after using for 10 days I feel left speaker fit inside is a bit shaking when I walk/run with these.
this could be just this piece, but I cannot replace as its over 10days.",4
"The earcups and the overall size of the headphones is quite small, it's just about enough for my head at the max adjustment level. Sound quality is nothing exceptional, it's just okay. The mic is kinda bad but it's usable. It came with a 3.5mm to 6.5 mm aux cable and a micro-USB to USB-A cable in-box. There is one 3.5mm port on one side and one 6.5mm on another for some reason, not sure why they couldn't just give a 3.5mm on both sides but that's not really an issue. Two stars because they're too uncomfortable and I cannot return and refund these, only replacements are available.",2
"Bass-boosted, crisp audio. Solid noise cancellation. design is thoughtfully executed with attention to detail. Comfortable fit. Excellent battery life. Gifted to my bro.",5
"The sound output is awesome. Dont think just go for it.
I have got it in 1799 during the sale, i will recomend u to wait for sale too.
At this price point the headphone delivers a nice sound signature with a thumping base.
In Bluetooth mode the sound is very loud and the battery last about 20 hrs. But in aux mode, the sound is less but you can fix it by toggling some settings in Realtek audio software.
Note- I have tested both Oneodio 71 and fireBoltt blast 1400, and i think they use the same drivers, the sound is exactly the similar. moreover, this one comes at a much lower price and gives u Bluetooth, what else do u expect.",5
"The headphones as a whole were very nice and comfortable and the additional 3.5 mm to DJ jack made it easier to save the already huge battery life. The headphones were working pretty well with the wire, but when I started using them on bluetooth more I started to realize that the sound quality was dropping and there was a lot of distortion, a few minutes into a wireless session of usage. Other than that I had no issues with the headphones.",4
"They offered me a music subscription if I wrote a review , but I am already having amazon prime. So this review is not due to their offer. Asother reviews said , the sound quality is superb. Some persons complained that it creats sweat around the ears. All the over the ear head phones will have that problem. If they provide outer air flow, then the outer noise also would come with it. So if you want noise cancellation then you have to accept this. I already used another brand's over the ear head phone, but this one provides much good sound quality then that. For this prize this kind of quality is so good. The only thing I want with this is mic. Due to the missing of mic I couldn't use this for calls . Regarding bluetooth connectivity, I place my mobile in one place and have this headphone and walk around in other rooms, the sound quality was same. And it perfectly connects with my smart TV . So overall good experience.",5
"It's quite nice but it's not as bass heavy as the Bluedio Turbine headsets. The bass feels good but it isn't a thump or a strong punch. It sorta feels muddy. I guess some people might prefer it, but I love having distinct bass pumps, without it blending with the highs. While acceptable, having heard better bass makes me somewhat disappointed. The build quality seems good, just take care of it by not being too brash.",5
Sound is good but there is considerable video lag (latency). There are also problems with Bluetooth connectivity when switching between devices. It is ok if you are only listening to music on the phone but definitely not recommended for watching videos or movies. I returned it immediately due to these reasons.,3
"First of all, I am not a sound enthusiast. I just wanted some nice bluetooth over-ear headphones for music/gaming.
I loved the sound, the bass was more than my expectations. The connectivity was also pretty smooth.
The price of these is great & definitely would recommend these.

Only issue that i faced was that when using wired mode, the mic on the headphones doesn't work. Which was a bummer when gaming especially.",4
"Good quality sound especially when volume is low.. strong built..
Person near can realise which song is being played.. Bluetooth connectivity is good..
However returned as my Sony Bravia tv is 2015 version which doesn't support Bluetooth headphones...
Bit costly product.",4
"The product is pretty good. Noise cancellation is good but not that much good, but I guess they didn't market the product with it. Battery life: I've yet to check it out fully. Cushions are very soft and comfy. Pretty decent sound quality. I think as a growing company they can do better with the packaging and accessories as they don't seem branded enough if you know what I mean. I am using it for just a day and my review reflect only on that.",4
"Best sound quality over the headphones. I have been using them for last 1 week and at this price the feature are crazy good. Great base, very good bluetooth connectivity and good range. Taken few calls as well and noise cancellation is good too. Have been using this in Gym as well but it has a small cons here while use is lot of sweat gets is what I see on the ear cups and have to clean and dry it after every 10-15 mins but that's with every over the ear headphones. Over all a great headphone for any music lover.",5
"Received a defective headphones initially where one speaker was not working. Replaced it. Working fine now.

Connectivity is hassle free.
Excellent quality sound while listening to music.
No seperate buttons for calls. Have to use power button for many.
Mic quality is good.

This is the first impression after using for few hours.

Will update a detailed review after using it for atleast a month.",5
"Review after 4 months of using 4-5hours (realtime usage) a day
Sound - 5+ (crazy bass, loud, beats, music)
Mic- 2.5-3 (Quite average or even little below average)
Price - 4 (bought it for 3.5k, under 3 would be great)
Noise Cancellation - 4 (Good but fades out with time)
Durability - 3.5-4 (Need to be used carefully, ear cushions flatten after daily use, Battery looses intensity with time running only upto 10hrs on full charge)
Note - I have used the product vigorously so it can turn out better for you than it sounds in the review.",4
"I really loved this one‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è.Perfect for music lovers-good sound quality and superb bass.It is really very comfortable..u can wear it for long time without hurting your ears.
This is my first purchase of headphones‚Ä¶I‚Äôm soo satisfied with this.
Literally I have searched 3days on internet..YouTube‚Ä¶for headphones below 3k‚Ä¶..I‚Äôm not satisfied with any of it‚Ä¶finally i got this one.
Read almost all reviews of this and finally decided to buy it‚Ä¶and i got itü§©",5
"First of all i wanna say that the package i received was horrible its like i bought some cheap product i think cheap products have good packaging than this, they should see this the way we are receiving our box and do something about it. And talking about the headphone its really good i like the sound quality, talking about the bass in the headphone bruh its next level you can feel the bass if you touch the side of the headphone its like pumping like boom boom, comfort is okayish i think its because of it's new it gonna take awhile to adjust to your head and get stretched the cushions and quality are good and in ear feel is great, connectivity is good, if you're a gamer use aux cable to play games like pubg because there's latency via bluetooth but with aux cable its great not a problem at all. So overall i do recommend this headphones
Comfort : 4 stars
Bluetooth : 5 stars
Sound quality : 5 stars
Bass : 5 stars
Mic quality via :
Aux : 5 stars
Bluetooth : 3.5/4 stars",5
"I especially liked the fit and the sound quality on this one. But MIC is a letdown at this price point. When I connect to calls from Teams/Google meet, the microphone suddenly stops working and I have to shout loud at the microphone in order for a person on the other side to listen. This is so unacceptable considering the price I have paid for this product.",3
Absolutely amazing. Seriously amazing. Bass is out of this world. Sound reproduction is top notch for my selection of songs (modern and heavy on instruments). Every frequency is addressed but this is a feast for bass lovers. I hope this lasts for long. Will be buying more pieces for my people.,5
"I use a bluetooth mouse and keyboard with my laptop. This headphone just cant connect if I have them connected. I also have Samsung Buds which connects and works well while all other devices are connected. And there are a lot of bluetooth connection related interference.

Its missing basic features like changing the song, the bass and sound quality is average as well. I would suggest either go with a headphne 1k - 1.5k range or stretch to 7k-10k. These middle headphones are as good as the 1k - 1.5k range except the built quality. the built quality is good, but what to do with build quality if sound and features are sub par.

Overall a poor buy",2
"I got this headphone for 3499. First impression is impressive and gives you premium feeling.

Here are some pros and cons based on first day usage.

PROS:
1) Very nice fit. You can jog and do all kind of exercise without worrying about it falling off.
2) Solid build quality. It won't break easily.
3) The earpiece is big enough to enclose whole ears so it does not cause pain. But it may depend on ear size.
4) Bluetooth connectivity is seamless. No issues found there. Aux cable is of good quality.
5) Sound quality is very clear and crisp.
6) Good noise cancellation.

CONS:
1) Bass could have been better tuned. Don't expect Sony like bass quality.
2) Initially it feels tight on the head so maybe uncomfortable for some. But overtime it should stop hurting maybe. I will update on this later.",4
"The sound effects and audio quality is really good. However, I started getting ear pain within an hour of continuous usage. Removing the headphones off my ears made me feel peaceful! There's something wrong with the ergonomics of the headset. L and R isn't mentioned on ear pieces and I tried all combinations and angles to reduce the ear pain while wearing. Tried different adjustment levels as well. But still, in the end it felt very uncomfortable and caused ear pain. I also observed distorted and loss of audio many times when connected to laptop via Bluetooth.

But on the positive side, this will not fall off your head easily and if you are someone who won't use it for more than 15-20 mins at a time, this is highly recommended!

Definitely a no for those who want to buy it as a multipurpose headphone to listen to music but also want to use it for 3-4 hours a day for office work, by connecting to laptop.",2
"First, I was mainly purchasing these headphones for the wireless and battery features. What I received was a great quality sound, and greater battery life than stated.

Pros:
- Battery Life - This was one of the biggest reasons for purchasing these headphones. I was looking for a set of headphones that would last longer than 4-6 hours and stumbled across these. I run the headphones for ~6-7hrs a day for four days. On the fifth day, I run the headphones until they turn off on their own. This normally happens around noon. This gives me a battery life of about 28-32 hours, beyond the stated 25 hours.

- Great Design ‚Äì I fell in love with headphone, from the time I set my eyes on it. It is stunning looking and great design.

- Sound Quality - The old headphones I was replacing with these were kind of tinny in sound quality. These headphones have really rich deep bass. I was extremely pleased with the sound.

Overall, it checks all boxes for a stunning Headphone at a very affordable price. I am very satisfied with my purchase",4
"Online classes is now part of life.. we can't avoid it. I have been using it for about a month already.
I think this is the best over-ear headphones in this price point.
Just go for it you wont regret it.

Pros:-
1.High sound quality
2.Very comfortable padding and design
3.It's bit heavier but due to comfortable fit, you will get used to it soon.
4.Grate battery life! A week after it's still on. Approx 40 hours usage time for my online classes.

Cons:-
1.Need to press power button for 5 sec which is too long for me
2.It is micro USB type charger",4
"I have big ears and I tried many headphones like boat, jbl etc but I was unable to wear it even for 10minutes hence I bought Fire Boltt over ear headphone. This is really amazing and extremely comfortable to wear for long hours. Sound quality is superb. Though physically it weights 240gms but its very light and when we hold are wear it feels very light. Highly recommend everyone to buy this product whoever is looking for using headphones for long time.",5
"Totally waste of money very poor sound & buttons also not work properly.
I think Amazon provide defective pieces.
I stop purchase through Amazon.
Really very very poor sound, my 200 rupees ear phone give much better sound.
Bolt kindly stop manufacturing if didn't know what is the sound quality.
Or don't sell defective pieces, can you please share your QA & QC method or policy.
To Amazon - why you were accept defective pieces or you are doing work like postman only.",1

"I have been looking for Bluetooth headphones (over the ear) in budget range with good bass. Finally, I have got it right.

It's comfortable as I have used upto 2 hours (that's all I have tried so far) and no pain or not much sweat on the ear.

Sound quality is pretty good, satisfied with bass and treble.

Call quality is average but that wasn't my requirement so I give it a pass.",4
"These sit very comfortably on my head

I don‚Äôt have a particularly large head and they fit nicely, but I imagine they would be better for someone with a big head.

Glow Lights : The Glow Lights effect is pretty decent. I am in college and this is Lights Headphone is truly a Head TurnerJ

Sound : Sound quality is also pretty good. Depending on the app/song I‚Äôm listening to, it can get EXTREMELY loud. So much so that I have to turn it down - which is saying something because I listen to my music on full blast most of the time.

Build : Build construction is solid enough. Pads are very soft and so far the body has been durable. I‚Äôve dropped these on the ground a few times and they are still performing fabulously.

Battery Life : Finally, and very importantly, the battery life on these is UNPRECEDENTED. I mean I will use these for hours a day for like 2 weeks in a row before even thinking about charging them.

Bluetooth connection is lightning fast and has superb distance. In an open field I‚Äôve used them further than 80‚Äô from my phone.",5
I heard these headphones through google. I think this is a frowd headset by fire boltt.I purchased to review more. BUT after this headphone I used i think a reality . DONT JUDGE BY A HEADSET BY ITS BRAND OR REVIEW. dear all this is a valuable VVVVVVVVVVVVVerygooddd headsetttt ... its bass is top 1 in world .please should buy it once then you love a lot. this headset material is plastic it comes with the premium LIKE ROLLS ROYCE...,5
Good product,5
"Good clarity, great batter life, and great design. It might seem a bit heavy after using lightweight headphones from others. However, the audio quality is quite nice. The treble seems to be higher and the bass lower than other co over-the-ear headphones.
Not sure why the black version is 500 Rs more than the Multicolor variant (which also has LED) though!",5
"Looks sturdy,nice bass , Good sound
Would be best for movies and music (in terms of sound quality)
Good battery backup
Not too comfortable (my ears pain a little even after wearing for less than an hour - may be because i have somewhat large ears)
Ears sweat after an hour (problem of each over-ear headphones)
No play next / play last button in wireless mode
Not checked in wired mode tho
Would be changing some settings with equalizer settings for gaming (mainly needed for bgmi , valorant , warzone etc..)
So if dont want to go for equalizer hassle, check any other one
Sometimes having problems with mic randomly
1 major problem for me - when attending zoom classes in background , and if by chance i consume media having audio , zoom class gets muted
Also zoom class volume also get muted if we try to switch between wired earphones and wireless mode
Definitely not for audiophiles",4
"Pros - great sound quality, amazing built quality, very comfortable, looks very premium.
Cons - bluetooth connection is not that fast, attracts a lot of dust, not for bass lovers at all unless you have Dolby Atmos in your device.
All this while I have been using sony extra bass wired headphones so I have found that the bass is much better on the Sony's. I won't suggest these headphones if you don't have Dolby Atmos. Overall I would rate this product 4.1/5.",4
"My ratings:
1. Sound quality 3.5/5 - Great for everyday use but now for professional work.
2. Comfort 5/5 - I have big ears and this fit me perfectly.
3. Value 5/5 - Good deal for ‚Çπ.2700/-
4. Ease of connectivity - 4/5 - Pairs quickly and has an AUX cable which is good.

Over all it's a great buy. Go for it.",5
"*Pros
The product is great. The highs and bass is not up to the mark but you can easily adjust that through Equalizer as you like which then works perfectly.
They fit perfectly over the ears and the noise cancellation is pretty decent.
The ear cushions are very soft and comfortable.
Bluetooth connection is very good, I tried it at 20 feet away and it worked perfectly without latency.
*Cons
The only thing that bothered me was that you can't wear it while jogging or even if you walk at a faster pace. Because the left earcup has something loose inside of it which makes noise as it shakes when you hit your foot on the ground while jogging. Which gets pretty annoying because you have paid 3k for this.
.
If you don't intend on wearing this product while jogging, I would highly recommend it at this price.",3
"Pros
- The sound quality is good
- Bluetooth connectivity is awesome
- As it's over the ear, so less noise disturbance

Cons (Reduced 1 star)
- Mic doesn't work properly when wired
- Submitting a review is mandatory for filling the warranty form.",4
"This mid-range priced headset - has unbelievably high fidelity and quality of sound - one can hear deep bass, rich mids and highs -- at loud volumes without feeling any distortion.
I would recommend this product as this had excellent audio reproduction and depth.",5
"The quality of the product wasn't that great including the feel of the physical buttons. But the sound quality was pretty good for the price range of the product. And it feels comfortable over my ear.
The battery life is great too.
And as described i could connect multiple devices at the same time.
Another thing that got me annoyed was the box was open when i unwrapped the packaging.",4
Liked the product and worth buying. Only downside that I felt was while calling it feels like you are sitting inside some empty room and speaking because of the noise cancelling which reduces the voice crispness. Not sure if all noise cancelling headphones do the same as this is my first buy with the feature.,5
"My review is about Fireboltt Blast 1400
Overall a decent purchase with a feature you do not generally find in headphones.

Pros
Sound quality.
Well built
Battery life
Mic quality. (Better than most headphones)

Cons
Battery low notification. It gets very irritating after the 30% mark as it starts interrupting the media and starts beeping every 30 seconds. It is bad for audio experience but good for battery health preservation as it becomes unusable after 30% you won‚Äôt ever let it get discharged too much. So sort of a pro through a con.

Bluetooth connection bugs. Sometimes on connecting via Bluetooth the audio comes first and then the video plays. The delay is about of 1 second. The bug has been observed across various devices. Phone, tablet and laptop.

Comfort. The headphone is over all very comfortable. The discomfort begins around after 5 hours of continuous usage which i feel is not a problem for most users. Even after 5 hours it‚Äôs not very uncomfortable but I wouldn‚Äôt call it comfortable either.

The special feature that I was talking about is audio sharing. Works even when you‚Äôre playing via Bluetooth and someone else connects a wired headphone to your headphones. Perfect for watching something together.
For wired connection connect the Boltt headphone via the 6.3 mm jack to audio source and connect the second headphone via 3.5 mm jack. The audio quality and sound levels do not fall on sharing.

I purchased at 2799‚Çπ. More than worth it at the price.

Full disclaimer: I‚Äôm getting 3 months extended warranty for posting a review. However, my review is honest, based on my experience of about a week, and not biased in anyway.",4
"My bad luck, return window closed a day before the battery rchd 30% or something and the headphones just not stopping that annoying beep sound coming continually. No clue how to stop (will probably call the company for help). Pretty irritating while talking to someone or listening to something over bluetooth. It's still beeping as I'm typing this comment. Not worth Rs. 2999. Material used is sub-standard; I have used cheap headphones before and based on my experience the material used will not last more than a year unless u take very good care of these. Noise-cancelling is a joke. It probably be good for those who like listening high volume and don't care for their ears. Impressed with Bluetooth 5.0 though (if it's really that). Wanted to give 3 stars, but it just beeped again :(.",2
This headphone has a good bluetooth connectivity along with active noise cancellation and clear sound output. It can be easily folded owing to its flexible build and superior design. The only thing which I felt was that it pressed a bit on the ears. The ear cushions are comfortable. The battery backup is equally good.,5
"Quality of this headphones is what I never expected in this price range.. It really shakes over your ears everytime the base hits. Same audio quality is shared with music sharing feature. Noise cancellation and bluetooth everything work's perfectly. If you are reading this to get a idea about the base then my friend.. can't express that in words, but you won't be disappointed.. Mark my words.",5
"This is an average headphone, inadequate noise cancellation, medium bass, sound clarity is good, Bluetooth connectivity is good. Disappointed, not worth for 3000
For an audiophiles this is not the good headphone",3
"Ao i don't generally write reviews, but these are THE best headphones that I have used in terms of sound quality. The depth of sound is best in class and bass is simply amazing.

The headphones have excellent noise cancellation and provide an immersive experience. They are quite comfortable, much more than any other headphones in the same price range.

One tip for buyers: I got these for 2500, but a couple of hours before I ordered the price was 3000, so be on the lookout for sudden price movements. Also don't buy the on-ear version of these (it costs about 500 less, as it is not going to be as immersive or comfortable as this one).",5
"Fire-boltt 1400 is an excellent product for audiophiles as well as for people with normal usage. Here's why :

Pros :
1. Sound quality is fantastic. Bass is very well adjusted i.e neither too high nor too low.

2. Built quality of the headphone is good. The earcups cushioning is fantastic and people won't find any problem using it for long hours.

3. The headphone does a pretty good job as far as active noise cancellation is concerned. But it's more of passive noise cancellation rather than active. Still you won't hear sounds from surroundings whenever music is being played.

4. Wireless connectivity is super fast because of Bluetooth 5.0

5. When you would receive the headphone it might look as a humongous piece which it is but it's storing and portability is fantastic since it is foldable.

6. Accessories provided are of great use. For eg - if you are using the headphone via Bluetooth connection and suddenly the charge flushes out then you won't have to risk your important work in between to charge the headphone instead you now will have the option to plug in the audio cable provided in the box and boom it will start working like a proper wired headphone.

7. Audio quality of mic is clear whether it's the inbuilt mic or the mic on the audio cable. You can definitely use it for live streaming or interviews or regular phone calls.

Con :
1. This can't be counted as a problem but still sometimes while listening to songs the vocals are little overpowered by the music and bass. But the difference is very negligible for majority of people.",4
"First of all no body likes to write a forced review, however here's my review after using it for 15 minutes.
1. Sound quality is okayish
2. No complaints regarding comfort
3. Bluetooth range is adequate
4. Build quality is fine for the price
Update 1: review after a few days
5. I am often noticing lyp sync issues with Netflix, YouTube and VLC, video lags behind the audio
6. Hearing a beep sound for every 10-15 seconds once the charging falls below 40%. It's almost impossible to focus on the audio with that distraction. This is not making any sense to me I mean no one needs an alert at 40%, suspecting that the percentage might be fake.
7. Can't use for more than an hour, ears are paining a lot.",3
"A great product under 3000rs, gives you a premium feel of headphones, just go for it.

Cushions are really soft.

It's designed for audiophiles.

Bass : 8.9/10
Mids : 9/10
Treble : 8.9/10

What else do you expect under 3000rs?",5
"Best in class battery life
It is a little bigger than I expected but it can be folded which is useful to carry along in my backpack. It has good noise cancellation and soft cushions help with isolation as well.
Good bass and sound clarity even at full volume doesn't sound tinny or sound doesn't distort.
Has similar performance and even better performance that some of the other expensive brands that cost 8-10K.",4
Met all expectations. Sound quality great. Bluetooth connectivity proper. Satisfied with the product at this price. Value for money purchase. I only hope that it continues to work properly for a long time. AS OF NOW ITS A GREAT PURCHASE. VERY HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT.üëçüëçüëç,5
"ros:
- Battery Life - This was one of the biggest reasons for purchasing these headphones. I was looking for a set of headphones that would last longer than 4-6 hours and stumbled across these. I run the headphones for ~6-7hrs a day for four days. On the fifth day, I run the headphones until they turn off on their own. This normally happens around noon. This gives me a battery life of about 28-32 hours, beyond the stated 25 hours.

- Great Design ‚Äì I fell in love with headphone, from the time I set my eyes on it. It is stunning looking and great design.

- Sound Quality - The old headphones I was replacing with these were kind of tinny in sound quality. These headphones have really rich deep bass. I was extremely pleased with the sound.

Overall, it checks all boxes for a stunning Headphone at a very affordable price. I am very satisfied with my purchase.",4
"Sound quality very good , specially the bass , its thumping at full volume and didn't break. I feel notice cancellation need bit impovement as some sound leake at max volume. Aux sound quality is not good. But anyway thats a secondary option when your power get discharged. Overall I m satisfied and it is sure value for money product. I got this during Amazon sale at 1700/-.",4
"The first impression wasn't really great but after using it for 2/3 weeks it feels great to use it.
I mainly bought it becoz of its size and the wired connection option at this price(2.5k) and it justifies it.
But unfortunately, the mic is very poor. If you work on a desktop, then you gotta connect with handsfree mode (which reduces to veryyy poor quality), and even after doing that the mic works low, then again you have to switch to stereo mode and turn off the mic to use nice quality sound...
But otherwise, the headphone is great, if u don't want great mic then Go For It...",5
"Balanced Sound !... Treble Is Perfect & Bass Is Also Great...Not Too Much Bass But It Will Be Pleasing to Everyone Cause It is high !...but not too high. Just Keep That In Mind. Also Good For Gaming ...A very little Bit of latency is there when you play while connected with bluetooth
But the aux cable given in package will give resolve that!
Just Go For It Best Headphones Under 2500rs",5
"Parts inside the headphones seem to be loose, they keep moving and creating unnecessary and annoying sounds even if you move an inch. The microphone catches ambience sounds like fan, wind, chair etc more than your own voice. Not a good product. I've bought better products for half the price.",2
"Built quality is ok and buttons are like cheap plastic and not at all good
But sound quality is amazing and top notch
Bluetooth connectivity is ok
But in this price range it sound quality feels like a premium product that worth of 35000 rupees in the other brands like sony boss etc brands,

Every one saying that its bass is too good
But that is wrong, bass oka actualy a good bass which good for ears

But if u are a melody lover wants hear good mid and lows
It is fantastic choice
I always love hear lowfi music with this head set which is so good

If you have minimum budget of 3500
But want a premium headphones like sony bass etc

Go for this you wont be disappointed",4
"Mind blowing bass, perfect mid and high. I own Marantz line of product preamp, amp, klipsh Speaker, JL custom sub. I love jazz, vocal, rock. When I lessen to music subconsciously I compare sound with my HT system :). This HP impressed me üëç",5
Hello Everyone Out there don't have words to describe about this beast really such an amazing sound quality and smooth and thumping bass and comfort level hi phenomenal thank you boltt for such a lovely headphones such an amazing experience i received in 2 days thank you to the seller for carefully sending this to their customers yes would recommend this product to everyone and will buy another one soon for sure thank you boltt team for such a fantastic headphones speechless really.,5
"After several considerations, finally I purchased Fire-Boltt Blast 1400 from Amazon. I just unpacked it and listened to few songs. I am delighted on this purchase. Call quality over bluetooth is not that much clear but ok. Overall nice product. Loved this product",5
"PROS
1. THE SOUND QUALITY IS REALLY GOOD (COMPARITIVELY)
GOOD ENOUGH BASS
HIGHS ARE GOOD
ONE OF THE BEST MIDS U COULD GET IN A HEADPHONE(IN THIS PRICE RANGE)
2. THE BUILD IS PRETTY STURDY
3.THE HEAD BAND CUSHION IS REALLY COMFY
4. SOFT EAR CUPS
CONS
1.HAVE TO USE A EQUALIZER TO GET THE BEST OUT OF IT CAUS THE HIGH ARE EAR PIERCING
2.EARS HEAT UP ON THE LONG RUN(2 TO 3 HRS)
OVERALL ITS PRETTY GOOD
GO FOR IT.....",4
"At such price range they are actually decent pair of headphones, sound is pretty good don‚Äôt compare with the wired headsets or other high end headphones and you won‚Äôt be disappointed, bass is pretty good also very good comfort, I wore them for max 3-4 hrs without any discomfort. Connectivity is good but just take few seconds once Bluetooth is on, instead of getting instantly connected like other headsets. Battery backup is excellent as mentioned, no noice cancellation just blocking only that much, an over ear cup can block",5
"The headphone, i get it today ( 18/05/20). Before this iam using skullcandy smokin buds 2, compare to that , the sound quality is amazing in this. The clarity on high level is could be improve. Loud and bass is great i would say. Iam Also having onemore piston earphone. But this is a beast. One negative i thought the late sound issue while connecting through Bluetooth ( pubg i ment )
I dont found any issues in music play and watching videos . I think this is a trust buy‚ù§Ô∏è. Thanks",4
"The music sound and bass quality is superb. I can even feel the extreme deep bass is equivalent to an iPhone earphones effect. The major drawback of this head phones is that you can‚Äôt use it for office meeting purposes. It is not audible to the other end of the person, tried with many options but no luck. If you want to use this only for listening music then go for it. If it is for office meetings, this is not the suitable one",3
"This Boltt headset ticks all the boxes when it comes to performance. Used it for 20+ hours and 2+ hour at a stretch without feeling uncomfortable.

Sound quality is just awesome and reviews of other guys does justice with the product.",5
"Love the sound quality and make......noise cancelling is also pretty good. Worth the money

when Bluetooth is turned off in headphones without disconnecting from the laptop and turned back on only the voice is gets connected, to get the music I have to reconnect it that is the only issue I have.

The above said issue only happens with laptops that too just initial connecting process.....................there are no connectivity issues during playtime.",4
I bought this headphone after a lot of study. Because I had to return another brand I had bought before. There is no other headphone in this price range to surpass it. I got the seductive price for just Rs 1799. The speakers give the feel of a studio room no matter how heavy the bass effect. Flipping earpieces provide proper ear positioning in the ear. The soft covering gives relief to the ears. The metal finishing body gives premium luck. I'm very happy to say that this headphone is better than the money I spent. Thank you Fire Bolt.,5
"Reviewing after use of 3 months.

The Left speaker has stopped working altogether without any physical damage. Have applied for replacement as still in Warranty period. Still no response from the Boltt team. Will update subsequently.

Pros : Sound Clarity is good, Comfortable on ears after long use, Classy looks for sure

Cons : Noise Cancellation needs improvement",3
"Just one word for this amazing headphones. Awwwwwesome... I purchased boat rockers first before o saw this masterpiece. And just after using one day, i returned boltt 140. That's what I am looking for. Big earcups, can be folded and above all, great sound quality. I got this all in this one and it's within my budget. Sound quality is amazing and battery life is good enough for a full day listening without pain in the ears. Though Noise cancellation is not up to the mark but still great in this budget. Overall i am very satisfied with this product.",5
"Like :
(1) Crisp music and base is very good.
(2) Mic is working fine when connected to through the 3.5 mm to 6.5 mm jack.
(3) Super comfortable earcup
(4) Battery back up is really good in this price range.

Dislike :
(1) Bluetooth connection remains good upto a certain distance but not upto 10metre for sure. Slightly unstable connection. Though when its near to you connection with music is continuous and stable.
(2) Facing some connectivity issue with mic of the Headphone while in a call in my laptop when using the headphone in Bluetooth mode.",4
The product is good . I bought it for 3000 and I feel it was a decent price ..the headphones look nice and the battery backup is good ...I get around 20 hours and the standby is great as well. Have been using the product for a week and have charged it just once . The volume is good...bass could've been better but it's decent ..sound quality is good too ...not the best but definitely good if you're upgrading from a lower priced headphone ...one problem that I've had is that the extenders on both sides are kinda small in length...I have a big head so they barely fit me...it's like if they were half a centimetre shorter they wouldn't have fit me at all...so if you have a big head try to avoid these ...other than that it's a great purchase !,4
"My first impression unpacking it was good. It can fully charged, my iPhone said 100% charged and connected in a second. My first song was very good. Good bass for the melody in Tamil I just love! Will use it for sometime and share my experience.",4
Firstly a huge thumbs-up for battery life...it lasted me for a week and i didn't worry about running out of juice. The built quality and the ear cushions are premium. It has a great bass and clear audio even on high volume. Noise cancellation is pretty good. im satisfied with the over all sound quality. I think at this price range boltt blast 1400 is the best choice. Enjoy your Music!!!,5
"At first I was hesitant to get these headphones..but now I'm glad I made the decision to buy and by far it's the best I've ever had.
One of the best over ear headohones. I'll start with the pros
1. The problem with over ear headphones are some times the cussion gets tight and your ear starts to pain. This is the most comfortable headphones and you can use it for hours
2. The Battery life is amazing and I haven't charged it since after I purcahsed it which is a month
3. Has a wired connet as well so you don't have to worry for the battery to get drained

Cons
1. Dont have any as of now

Over all firebolt is the headset worth the money",5
"The best product
5star quality
Soft noise cancelling
The beat are ausome and the connection are excellent.
But first time you wear this it may be slightly uncomfortable but if you use regularly you will find your correct ‚úÖ‚úî‚òësize .
Then you get 100% correct sounds and music üé∂and it will be Confertable.
The battery üîãis incredibleü§© the best battery support. if you use Contiouslsly the charge doesn't go down it will remain at 92%.
9mm jack wires are in good condition and
I will recommend you to buy this product.",5
Product is as per the description in the order page. Worthy buying. The best Headphone I have bought. The sound result is excellent and very comfortable wearing the headphones. I recommend this product in this price range with great features....,5
"I am using the product for about 2 months now and its been a good experience. I never liked the padding of headphones with passive cancellation, but since this product has multiple degrees of flexibility, its very comfortable. The sound quality is very good for the price paid. Its a worth product. Only negative I find is that the battery life is good as promised, but when at 30% or so the device continuously beeps alerting low battery. Also, when the battery is about 30% low, the mic is almost not functional. Noise cancellation is pretty good given that it is passive.
But, overall built quality and design is amazing. Sound quality is surprisingly good - nice bass. And it is pretty cheap for the specs.",4
"All is ok no complaints but how to turn off low battery notification sound coming from the bluetooth headset is not mentioned in the manual that is received in the box packaging, and trust me thats irritating the headset starts notification beeps every now and then at 40% battery life. comfortable to wear for around 3-4 hours minor discomfort felt after that",3
"I have been using it for a couple of days now and here are my impressions about the product:

Pros:
1. Very comfortable. This over the ear headphones perfectly cover the ear completely (medium and large ears as well).
No discomfort is experienced even after prolonged usage ( 3-4 hours continuously).
2. Pretty good sound quality. The 40 mm driver does the job really well. All the frequencies can heard very well.
3. Battery life is quite good. Can easily last a couple of days.
4. Good cushioning is provided.
5. No Bluetooth disconnectivity issues observed.

Cons:
1. Noise cancellation could have been improved. At volume above 80% level, person next to us can listen the sound clearly.
2. They are quite big in size which might be an issue to a few people to carry while travelling.

Overall, the product has good value for money and I am quite satisfied with it.",4
"The product broke in 2 months of normal usage, but they replaced it.
The headphones fit snugly over the ears, but does not give complete noise cancellation. Sound quality is good. Bluetooth connectivity causes problems sometimes, as it gets disconnected if you are not playing anything. Wired mode is much more reliable.",4
"This headphone is best in it's range. I even tried JBL 750btnc but I found this one better. Really awesome product at low price. Great bass, Awesome sound quality, Passive noice cancellation actually blocks the outside voice to some extent and Bluetooth connectivity is also great. Overall I am in love with these headphones. Thank you Amazon for providing me a great product. I highly recommend this product.üòÉüëç",5
"Beware of this product. If you have received the product in good working condition without any issues, then it's well and good. But in case if you find any issues or fault like me, then you are screwed. Their customer care is worst I have ever seen. One side of my product was faulty and have registered a complaint at their office website. They have also arranged for a pickup and received the product back. After that there is no response at all. They neither gave replacement nor refunded the amount. They dont have customer care number and they don't respond to their email also. I am still following up with them for more than 3 months. So be careful while buying the product.",4
"Product really amazing...It is very comfortable and reliable to use . And I use it for my office meetings and conference calls. Light in weight.
Talking about bass , it has geat quality of baas and has a very long hour backup battery. I have used to listen music too it is simply smooth in having a product like that.
I have rated 4 star, as there is always need of improvement.
Overall design compatibility and reliablity are great.",5
"The best headphone with in the money range.
Amazing sound quality with good bass as promised.
Even the quality of product is very good, looks like premium product.",5
"Blast 1400 is a good product. At the given price, it delivers crystal clear sound with a decent bass and has a solid built quality. Ambient noise suppression of the in-built microphone could be improved though. On occasion, the microphone tends to pick up a lot of background noise. However, the in-line mic of the supplied aux cable is excellent. Overall, I'm satisfied with the product.",4
"Amazing product, one of its kind, you can contact both wired and wireless , bluetooth connectivity is good, one secret is that you can connect an extra pair of earphones at the same time using 3.5mm jack provided in the headphone, i.e. two in one...Amezing..
Sound quality is good, not over bass, balanced sound...
Comfortable in wearing for long hours at least 1.5 to 2 hrs without any discomfort...
Very much satisfied with the product,only to check durability/longibity.",4
"Okay So the sound 8.5 /10
quality of the sound 8/10
Weight 7.5/10
And guys i would like you all to know that these headphones have very low quality control...i bought the first one and it had left ear piece of it loose....and now as i got the replacement these one slides off your head from backside...so when you are doing some work gaming editing and taie stretch sitting these will fall out from your head towards your behind.
SOUND LEAK is TOO MUCH at full volume.",3
"These headphones are great, especially considering the price.

The main selling point of this Headphone, are the colorful Glow Lights. They really make them stand out. The lights change colour with music.

The audio quality is outstanding too! Heavy bass and powerful sound. Very clear and pleasing to the ears.

The ear pieces are also big... They are comfortable enough to wear for long hours.",5
"I received used and damaged product and requested for replacement with sealed item

After 3 days waiting go new set and this time overall product is great.

Sound clarity is awesome, boss is good
Noise reduction is ok ok and microphone sound is also ok ok",4
Very poor performance.. Mic not working as expected and I don't see any noice cancellation... It may good for listening music... While talking people are listening too much background noice... However they are saying noice cancellation features,1
"Its been more than 2 weeks of using the product. The sound quality and bluetooth connectivity range is amazing! I don't use it for attending calls however, use it to watch movies back to back and listen songs. Very comfortable cushion pads for ears and over the head which makes it irritation free when you wear the headphones for longer time. Generally, I get headaches when using the normal earphone for more than 20-25 min. but the Boltt Blast does wonders :) I'm watching movies back to back for 5-6 hours.",5
Adding review after 5 months of use. Bluetooth is pathetic within 5 months people are having difficulty hearing my voice. I have stopped using bluetooth and only rely on wire connectivity. So not good headphone if you want to use for calls. It is just good for listening music that's all. And in more 3 months time the plastic broke in a way that now that I can't wear. So bad quality as I believe it was not able to handle stress of removing headphones from head using one hand.,2
"1) The angular movements of the ear pieces are restricted.
2) It doesn't become completely flat.
3) It doesn't curve alonwith your head's curvature but just touches the top of your head like a bow (instead of a semicircle). It has a very different and rather awkward fit. A much cheaper boat Rockerz 560 is much more comfortable than this one.",3
"Giving a 3 star rating since the product is not used and experienced. Please don't force us to write reviews while registering for the warranty of the product. First look, the product is big, covers the ear and value for money. Noise cancellation is decent in a normal environment, but yet to put it to a rigorous test. Will put a detailed review later.",3
" For this price, you can go for a better product.

‚Ä¢ In Bluetooth mode

a) Mic won't be working. Another person in Call, they can't hear you. But it works perfectly.
b) Sometimes connectivity is not clear/goes off.

‚Ä¢The audio jack length is too short.

""Don't go for this product"" - If you want Bluetooth based Headphones.",3
"I like the product, it has a great sound quality and comfort fit for this price. Good one from the available over the ear headphone, need to use it for some months and comment about its durability",4
"Good Quality, Soft ear cups.
one quick observation: Using 3.5mm to 3.5mm jack you cant listen to music. 3.5mm port is provided only for music sharing but not for listening to music. Not sure whether every product has this issue or only mine. 3.5mm port IN is not available.",4
"The headphones rather it‚Äôs mic is very average when it comes to online meetings or conferences. That is, the sound is barely audible at the other end.So I am disappointed with firebolt as I bought specifically to participate in online discussions.",3
"Excellent Sound. Comfortable to wear. Value for money. Only thing to be mindful is that when connected via aux cable only speakers of headphones work not its mic. So if u connect the headphones via aux cable to pc, it wont act as a headset with mic",5
"Great headphones- Good sound quality and Bluetooth connectivity is quick. Can connect both Mobile and laptop at the same time but the ONLY issue is as soon as the call is connected, the Bluetooth turns off automatically(when connected with two devices). The battery life is 20H and not 25H. Other than that everything is great for the price!!",4
"Writing this review 8 months of use :

Sound quality is excellent with good bass. Battery back is gd, upto 10 hrs,however the beep at 40% battery level is irritating and the device can't be used after that without charging. Bluetooth connectivity tone is not that great.one more disadvantage is the wearing comfort on the ears which is only 3/5

These Cons apart, it's a value for money headset",5
"Product overall is good.
However what I observed so far is, tough on the packaging Boltt is maintaining standard but on the headphones the name printed differently as ""BOLTT"" / ""FBOLTT"" / ""FIRE BOLTT"".
I am confused which one is genuine. The main part is same confusion they have created on there website as well.

I really appreciate if BOLTT revert with response and accordingly I can give or edit this feedback.",3
"This was the perfect headphone I was looking for. The features I wanted was,
1) Mic to attend calls.
2) headphone with cable to connect to with laptop.
3) Cordless headphone to use while connected to phone.
4) Headphone with good noise cancellation

This model from bolt was tailor made for me.",5
Looks great! But not a good fit on the head. Product is made of cheap plastic. Does not look durable. No return available. Bluetooth and battery is great. Sound is mediocre.,3
"Pros:
- Great battery life. Using it daily for 7hrs and charges it once in 10days.
- Sound Quality is awesome especially the bass. Definitely recommended to music lovers.
- Good in noise cancellation. Can be used for calls as well.
- Very comfortable and are at affordable price
- The Bluetooth connective is good. Can be used 10 ft away from the connected device.

Cons:
- Connecting cable can be a little longer.
- Don't have a pouch to carry it out. Will be good if there is one so the product will not be damaged easily.",4
"pros:
Bass(it successfully achives frequency from 20hz to 20khz easily but i dont recommend for longer use with higher volume)
Battery(morethan what is stated)
connectivity option(even after having a missive battery this also comes with an AUX as a bonus)
cons:
bluetooth range(it starts struggling @6m+)
size & weight(you will feel the wight for sure since it houses a powerfull bass driven driver & powerfull battery)",3
"Finally I got the correct one. If you are looking a comfortable, less ear pain blutooth headset, then this is the one... Cushion is too soft.. no ear pain at all... good sound.. i am using this for my android VU tv. Recommended..",5
"Writing this review after 3 months of use. The headphone is good enough. You can use it straight for 2-3 hours it won't hurt your ear. Connectivity is also very good. Charge is also very good. One advantage of the headphone is you can use it with wired connection as well. So, that helps when you're out of charge. Microphone also works fine but could be better. Another thing is, the bass sound could be better. Very good treble though. Overall it is a good purchase",4
If you want a over the ear headphones under 5000$ this is the one I have the jbl t500bt and the boat rockerz 550 but in this headphones the bass and sound are good then other and battery last longer then these two other headphones and also there is 0 sound leaks and better noise cancellation,5
Bluetooth mic is very weired. While calling it produces humming sound and a long continuous loud Sharp beep sound. produces cont. sharp crackling sound that is unbearable to the ears. It seems it will damage my ears and I have to disconnect the call. This headphone is of no No use to make calls over bluetooth mic.,2
BOLT BH1400 headphone is for them who loves deep bass.The bass is more than expected also sound clarity is good.It is recommended one who has big head too.when music is played using aux cable sound is good but can be improve..By the way music clarity is same but volume is little low when music is played ising aux cable and i think it can be improved in Boltt new headphone series..It is more than expected at this price... So one can go blindly if they are looking to buy it..I am sure you would love it with its music and deep punching bass...üéßüéßüëçüëå,5
" Got it yesterday and at the first use, the sound quality is awesome as I was expecting. Looks sturdy and stylish when you put it on your head. Covers your ears completely and good noise canceling. I was looking for headphone which can fix well and lightweight while I go for jogging. This headphone definitely solve the purpose being most lightweight. The bass quality is also good. Let's see, how long it will work.",5
This head phone is the lightest one can imagine in this category of ear phones . It also cover the ears comfortably and does not irritate the ears or cause any pain . The sound quality of the speakers is good . However it found that the mic quality is not upto the mark with the result one needs to speak up for the other person to hear . The blue tooth connectivity is also awesome Overall a great experience and value for the price,5
"I have been using this product for more than a couple of weeks and I can vouch for the quality of the product. At this price, this is the best headphone that you can find. The sound quality is great. So is the bluetooth connectivity and battery. It's stylish and durable. The only smallcon could be that at full volume, you can sometimes feel a little vibration in the headphone. But it's minute and negligible.",4
Very bad disappointment .....sound like regular .....cheap headphone ....not comfortable to use ...too heave,1
"A great product. Audio quality, battery life, look and feel, bluetooth connectivity all are really good.
I did not find any cons yet..!
A good quality Indian product which is reasonably priced.

EDIT: I bought 2 more Boltt fire 1400 for my dad and sis.
I came across 1 CON after using this headphone for a week i.e. at 40% battery the headphone starts beeping every 10 secs to warn for low battery, which is really irritating.
The good part is the headphones reached 40% after 6 days of continuous use of around 5-6 hrs per day.",5
The sound quality of these headphones is just awesome! I bought these headphones for my online classes and they do their Job perfectly. The fitting of the headphones is so much comfortable that you will not realize for how long you have worn the headphones. They are very lightweight and much comfortable. They cover your entire ear and give good physical noise cancellation. Overall recommended to buy.,5
Just got this product and connected to my laptop right away. Connected seamlessly without any problems and worked perfectly fine. Lovely Bass. Music is crystal clear. Ear cushions are real soft for extra comfort of the ears. Can be foldable while travelling.,5
"Build quality and Every thing is fine with the device in terms of blue tooth connectivity, sound quality, durability quality etc...

I bought this headphones for office calls. Seems that purpose not filled properly. When we connect to lapy sometimes we suddenly lose mic connection. And other end people not able to hear properly in decent environment. There is lot of space to improve mic quality. Unfortunately not seeing return option after 10 days.",3
"After 2 days , audio started to break down and crumble, replaced it with another Boltt 1400, this time received a headphone with dirt and white hair pieces on it! The box was also damaged and pinched! Are they expecting me to wear that? Please, improve your customer service and the quality. I bought because of all the good reviews but now I think all the reviews are good because they ask you to review you and after that you can get a membership and warranty!",2
"Plus
Sound quality is excellent
Battery backup is good

Minus
Mic is average to hear, not suitable for office meeting
Over head is very hard to wear, giving head ache if we continue wearing more than an hour",3
"Good looking one as well sufficient features. Even though it's stated that it can support 10 m wireless support but from one room to other room have some disturbance, also it's bit tight to use long time.
Within 6-7 months of use the Aux cable stops to work and Boltt service team denied to rectify the same even though the product within the warranty period. So, I would ask everyone to think twice before have it.",2
"1. Stylish product, with good ear cushions. 2. Little problem with Bluetooth connectivity at times.
3. No noise cancellation at all.
4. Good audio quality
5. Worst thing- when on call, other person can hear different beep sounds along with voice",4
"these a the first-ever headphones that I had ever purchased and they turn out to be awesome.these are the best headphones under its pic range with a huge amount of battery life, durable build quality material, super bass, clean sound, and the nice part is we can control itself everything in the BlueTooth mode but not in cable, so go ahead and try it you won't disappoint.",5
Good quality headphones in this price range with very good long lasting battery....and noise cancelling is great too.....audio quality is also very good I can hear words in videos clearly even at very low volume which I couldn't with earlier headphones I had....! Go for it guys these are very nice headphones üî•,4
Overall it is a very good product in this price range. Isolation of outside noise is good due to large and soft cushion pads on both the ears. Sound is goods with clear mids and highs. Bass is balanced and mixing with overall experience. Overall headphones are bit delicate and required to handle with care for long term usage. Mic quality is great and sound quality during calls at both ends is satisfactory.,4
"Sound quality:10/10
Bass:10/10
Build quality:6/10
Mic :below average
The headphone fits sturdily over your ears but it is a little bulky looking,you will not feel the bulkiness and it's comfortable
The drawbacks I found was that it is made of cheap
Plastic and the mic sound is very low",3
Comes with an aux and is noise cancellation. I couldn‚Äôt hear anything after putting the headphones on even when the volume of the song was low. The ear cushions are extremely soft and comfortable. The headphones overall are very high quality.,5
"Sound quality is good.
Bluetooth connectivity is good.
Mic is average .
Passivenoice cancellation also good.
Only cons is with aux volume of sound is little drop other than this overall product is good in this price.",5
"Pros:-
Works perfectly with Mobile laptops
good for joining meetings on laptop
comfortable ear cups
perfect vocals and beats

Cons:-
poor mic quality when used for phone calls
doesn't work properly with Android TV huge amount of disturbance and noise and connection issue.",3
"Can be preferred not the best in this range but ok.
Battery life great
Connectivity I can notice a visible lag in my linux machine and negligible lag in my mobile
Not suitable for gaming. If u go for gaming must skip this
Bass great at higher volumes",4
Product is broken in less than a 6 months. Poor build quality and cheap materials used for rotating locks also. I seriously dissatisfied with the product. And I am not a rough user. I bought some other head phones also they are good.,1
"Update after 1 day. Returning since the mic is not working. Thought 2999 was a great price. Audio quality also was quite good. Sad to return it. Unfortunately the company does not have a customer care number. There is option to only send an email.

Would update again after using it for a week or two",1
Honest review...not the best in noise cancellation. But the sound quality is very good for the price range no idea about the battery life will edit after one week of use for hard-core music fans this is the product but the most I liked was that it fits my head and ears and the pads are very comfortable.packaging and shipping was also good for me . One thing to remember it's not bass heavy one.hope it helped you‚úå,5
"Product is good, the main thing is the rotational/tilting design of the product which adjust according to yours ears and whatever the shape of your head, this will fulfilled my needs which I thought that the over ear headphone had. Sound is clear, bass is good that much I had prefer and Bluetooth connectivity is good too. If you have a big ear this headphone is for you, i think even small ears can also will be comfortable with it. In my perception this headphone has better design with the other competitors in the market....honestly recommended..",5
"This product is really good for gaming. There is no sound delay and the sound quality is good as well. I would recommend this for gaming. The only issue with this is that it is pretty big and the design isnt that good so its not good for casual use. There are other headphones with better and simple designs at the same price range so I wont recommend this for causal use. However, it's a nice gaming headphone.",4
"First of all i have to say this is the best wireless headphones around 3k. It's good for listening to music, playing games etc. It has a long battery life, I charged it for 30 mins and it lasted me for 2 days. My problem is that the 3.5mm jack when connect to a pc u may have to change it position sometimes to get a clear sound or else it will sound distorted. Overall very good headphones In my opinion.",4
"This product is of good quality. Its sound is really good. Pitch is high along with great quality base. Overall it is a delight to listen music through it, I am very happy and would recommend.",5
"These headphones stopped working in less than 2 months, and the headphones were somehow picked up for replacement but after that it has been one month, no response from Boltt and also the customer service told that they have no complaint from me and disconnected the call. No response over mail also. Worst service.",4
"Brought these for my father in law, as he loves listening to music. news and movies....awesome sound and comfortable.
He used them for a day so far very happy with the sound quality.

He listens to Google assistance read SMSs :D
Thumbs up for this product from me!!",5
"The sound quality is crystal clear and the cushion quality is too good and you can wear them easily even with glasses. One thing that I really liked is the connected/disconnected sound . My previous headphones had a really irritating high piched sound but these ones have a really good one. But when connected with the dj cable provided , the sound is not that good but with bluetooth it's just amazing.",5
Good product but little problems with the bluetooth connectivity which at the same time i used the 6. jack but it‚Äôs acceptable for the price but in the product page it was shown that the top cushioning was white but I received it with a lite skin colour (show on the photo) overall it‚Äôs fine well build product though it‚Äôs a plastic body but even Sony has plastics can‚Äôt complain,4
"Bolt aggread to replace when the product is defective, but after I sent for replace they sent me same product. Do not trust these bolt.I feel I wasted money on this bolt company product I will never buys from this company",1
"The product is good, but the quality of this earphone is very bad..it's just been 40 days and it already broke in the side. Is there any service center that can fix it?",2
"Built is sturdy, noise cancellation is pretty good. Sound quality is pretty good too, but not premium quality. Emphasis on deep bass (which is delivered, full marks for that) compromises the overall sound balance just a little. In my opinion 'premium' products should cater to 'premium' industry quality sound, not popular demand.

Other than that, total value-for-money product.",5
"There is no noise cancellation, but there is noise isolation. The sound quality is below average for this price. There is no bass. U could get same sound quality with 100 rupees earphone.",3
"*** Update ***
I got rye nee piece replaced in 3 days after raising issue. Thanks to Amazon and seller for the wuick replacement. So far it appears that all features are working.
Changed rating to 3 stars.
If everything works rven after 3 months, stars may change. üòä
****************
This product is ok. But the basic feature aafter sound is charging. It is not working. No red light lit. Not charging at all. Disappointed with product. It is waste of money.",3
"Noise cancellation is not at all effective while call but while music is somehow okay.
Bluetooth connectivity sometimes lag
Sound quality is amazing wired/wireless, I love the sound and thumping does justice to the price
This is one day review will add 6 month review too after using it properly.",4
Amazing headphones. Bought them for listenin to music. Bass is powerful. Feel premium and are super comfortable. Purchased them in Prime Day Sale for ‚Çπ1799.,5
These little heavy on ear . The aux cable provided is ok but the other normal aux 3.5 to 3.5 is missing . If we use our purchased aux cable the male point has to be keep some part from female part out . Becoz after putting the 3.5 pin to the systems piece it is not giving full sound .,4
"It is best at its price range
Got it just before lockdown started
2 months since and not a single problem
Noise cancellation is pretty good but not perfect (you have to get at least 7000 rs for perfect noise cancellation)
Bass is perfect, any song will play with complete instruments
Surround sound is awesome, play with any game
Battery is very good offering 24 hrs
No regrets",5
"Headphones look's awesome on me.
Bluetooth connectivity is very fast.
Nice battery of headphone work so long in day
So comfortable , fixable, nice base , quality of sound is nice.
Best for gaming.
Easily cover whole ear.
Looking wise is also good .
We can also wear headphones when we are doing exercise like heavy cardio skipping, running, cycling .
We Can also wear in gym while doing weight lifting .",5
"I wanted to purchase these headphones for the wireless and battery features. After testing it, I feel that the battery is really good and the sound is also awesome.
Pros:
# Battery Life - This was one of the biggest reasons for purchasing these headphones. I still need to test it.
# Sound Quality - Sound is great.",5
"I just received this headphone yesterday. I spend most of my free time listening to music. I have been a regular user of headphones. The moment I put on Fire-Boltt Blast, I could clearly sense a distinct change in my music listening experience. I remember reading many reviews before I purchased this product - I think this is clearly an exceptional product and more importantly it was well within reach from a price perspective. Completely delighted with my purchase.",5
"Overall product quality is very good, they are comfortable. Bluetooth Connectivity is too good, now the major part of headphones is sound ""Sound is awesome!!"". And Battery Life is fantastic, on a full charge if you use it 2 hours for a day, it will last the whole week and some more days.

Charging of this headphones takes time to charge this big battery.

I have one concern, that it in-box aux cable should have mic on it.",4
"Pathetic product. It stopped working after a few months a usage. The warranty period is just a show. I have been chasing customer care for 5months now. The product is still with me. No progress made. There are many out there who got cheated and still waiting for their products. Please check in the interest and twitter, probably u get a better about bolt",1
"Noise cancellation and sound quality are very good. Audio output quality is not good when taking internet calls (whatsapp, WebEx etc). It's good for regular calls. Over ear comfort is not as expected, but will come to know better once I use the product for a month or so.",4
"It is a very awesome headphone in this price range. it's hard to get over the head premium headphones in this range. along with with it 3-months gaana.com subscription and one movie ticket. totally value for money.
- premium quality.
- nice built.
- great sound quality..
- great battery life.
- great noise cancellation",5
"The headphones are very comfortable. Sound quality is also pretty good.
The ear cushions are very comfortable if you tend to use for long hours specially meetings and hearing music. I purchased it cause I was looking for connecting via bluetooth as well as using aux cable. Have used just for few days and have not seen any issues.",5
"this product was nice but not best
If u want it for bass only then u must go for it
but if u want it for studio work like me.....
dont buy it.....
vocals are not clear
build quality is nice....
Bluetooth connectivity is very bad if u put phone in pocket it the song does not play clearly (audio lag)
comfort of headphones is just amazing.......",3
" Nicely built, soft leather/rubber on sepakers.. Soft head cushion. Rotation function.. Aux compatibility with both type of pins (3.5 and 6.5). But price seems little on higher side.",4
"After gone through the review only I bought this device but the bluetooth connectivity is not at all good. I'm hearing the broken sound only if the device connected via bluetooth. Once switched with wire, it's normal but the volume I can hear is very low compared with bluetooth connectivity. This is my first day experience. The Device's body looks rigid though.",3
"Just received product they want review from me then only they allow to register my product for warranty.
But after testing I must admit‚Ä¶ headphones sound is awesome and enough loud‚Ä¶. Hope so it‚Äôll last long.",5
Thode din use krna k bad. . Muje nahi lagta me pure din laga k kam kr sakta hu kyuki garam( heat produce kr raha h) ho raha h bhai . . Abi to thik h par garmi me use krna bohut hi muskil h aur bat kre sound quality ki average base h. . Noise na k barabar h par 100% nahi. . Bluetooth connectivity me muje to koi issue nahi hua ( using phone OnePlus 6t & Ipad ),4
"Good quality construction. Sturdy. Sound quality is excellent. The bass is awesome and the trebles are clear.
Fits comfortably over the ear. It can also be connected by bt and by aux cable provided. Re√ßommended .",4
Worst one no stable Bluetooth connectivity no noise cancellation all the given description are not satisfactory and I had ordered replacement 2nd time but this time delivery guy hasn't called me and even if I call him through the given OTP based number he is not picking the call bcoz they are trying to delay my replacement hence I cannot return it.,1
"Nice build quality with premium looking material. Quite sturdy design. Sound quality is also good for this price range. It works almost with every device like mobile, laptop, firetv.

The only con I came across was the mic. But I will update my review once I thoroughly test this for more couple of days to find out exactly what's wrong with the mic.",4
I got it for 2500 and I am writing this after a usage of 2 months .the vocals are really clear as compared to other headphones in this range but u won't feel the beats unless it's on 100 percent volume and there is not much of noise leakage and it's great for gaming and suitable for wearing long hours cause the ear cups are really comfortable,5
"It is a good product , but when it comes to attend a call and answer it from this headphone , i found it difficult as the other person is not able to hear my voice from my side and i am also not able to answer the other person. I have to answer loudly , so if you are in a public place , you have to answer the call after disconnecting it from your device.",4
"Look like it makes me a DJ or a Singer or a musician or a music director. It's Bluetooth is supreme , make me in a dream as music environment. Thanks.",5
"This is a great set of headphones and are just a wesome at this price, plus they are over ear and fit on my big head perfectly, plus the sounds are crisp, clear and high quality, the bass is good not really high but gives you satisfaction, I have used this to play ghost of tsushima and it was really good in performing with games, overall a great buy go for it.",5
"Jist an average product. Its only about Bass , rest of them it compromises all. You can not wear them for long hours at all they will hurt your ears. Worst thing is that even person beside you can listen mote than you. Wasted my momey. Doesn't recommend. Stopped working just after 5 months.",1
"Pros:
1. Good Sound Quality
2. Good Bluetooth Range.

Cons:
1. At first you will feel discomfort due to tightness.

I will wait till the disconfo2 due to tightness get reduced ober period of usage.",4
"bought this item and now realise it has voice lag when playing games with bluetooth, the lag is not there when we use a wired connection. now i want to return it and not replace it because this issue will be with replacement also. but amazon is not allowing return option ??",1
Ordered this product for online and the bluetooth is not working and stopped charging and wire connection to head phone is loose. Don't go for this product. Horrible experience.,1
"The product package was really bad, inside package box was open when I had received from delivery guy. I have used it for a week and now I see left speaker is broken inside and I can hear the broken piece sound if I shake it a bit. sound quality was okay, I thought of using it thogh it is average and now it is broken and am unhappy with this purchase",1
"I paid so much for this headphone
I have used tons of headphones but this headphone sound quality sucks to b honest .
Built quality no doubt it's better than most of the headphone but if u r a gamer and a music lover with bass an all this headphone is not for ypu. Don't buy it. ...I regret but it's too late now",2
"Pros
- Great sound quality (both audio In & Out)
- Convertible as wireless or wired
- Fits well in the ears if you like the bulky headphones
Cons
- Observed Interference with home WIFI signal when using wireless mode. Even disconnection in my VPN connections. i now use it mostly in wired mode and i still like it because of the sound quality",4
"Doesn't provide any option to turn off that annoying beep when battery's low. Mic only works with bluetooth. It doesn't work with wired connection. Voice recording quality is bad too.
Some internal hardware got detached and it makes chattering noise everytime i shake the headphone. Really Annoying.",1
"A decent product given the price range. noise cancellation, sound quality and Bluetooth range are all satisfactory. Coming to the built, it is a bit large on the head so I guess it comes down to personal preference. Overall a good product.",4
"The headphone sounded much better than the known brands in the market.
The quality of bass, treble and vocals is really good.
These are bulky and looks durable to me.

The only think which is missing is that the noise cancellation feature is not at all promising.
I would definitely recommend everyone to buy these headphones.
They are low in price, great in sound and connectivity.",4
"My ears are getting real warm after using the headphones for 30 mins; a big drawback as I had bought this for office call purpose.
Noise cancellation is average as many a times office colleagues have asked to switch the fan off for better clarity from my end.

I am disappointed with this investment.",3
 I have buy this product at 1799/- so buy at same price. It has decent built quality. 40mm Drivers works very good you can use it for watching contents or anything on phone with crystal clear tone. BT 5.0 works in home for 10 to 12 feet perfectly and in open area it works good till 8 feet distance.,4
"A good product and a great value for buck. Probably the best wireless headphones you can buy for this price range.

Bluetooth works fine but it takes a few seconds to connect each time.

Sound quality is good, but not comparable to high quality headphones that cost way more.

Build quality is excellent. No complaints there.",4
"got this product on Tuesday, delivered on time. product package was good. sound quality was so good that i thought music was playing in my laptop in front of me but i didn't know that it's connected automatically. later i realised that it's in my BOLTT headset. great sound experience. i strongly recommend this product in affordable budget.",5
" Update: fireboltt contacted me for a replacement, good post delivery customer service.",5
"as of 3 days of usage i am very satisfied with the comfort and the battery life. The headphones are enormous and my god the bass is unreal. Would recommend. Only problem was, although the headphone was not damaged, It arrived with an open package inside which was a bit disappointing. But quality of headphones covered for it. Also, for passive noise cancellation, these are really good.",4
"Not worth of 2500‚Çπ for this head set, I liked the size of cushion, sound and comfort but if you are using Bluetooth and your phone is a meter apart from headset there is a lot of disturbance and sometimes it get disconnected,",3
"Excellent product. Comfortable headset and very good sound quality. Would definitely recommend.

Edit: after 6 months of usage, both earpieces have come out of their groove and it‚Äôs difficult to glue them back in. Definitely a poor design or assembly issue",3
"Very comfortable and soft sponges. Good bass, sound quality.
Cons: Micro USB charging - all my devices are typeC i need to carry Micro USB cable to charge headphones
MIC: MIC quality could be improved, even when there's no noise in the surroundings volume transmitted through MIC is low",5
"Pros:
Battery life, Sturdy and lightweight
Cons:
Over tuned bass, not suitable for taking calls as mic reception is very very poor.

Recommend for gaming and movies. If your preference is for calls, or you are sensible music lover....please avoid",3
"Initially i received a faulty product but, it got replaced within 2 days. It's been a week time and no complaints yet. Hoping to see it working for a long period of time.",4
"Good BT headphone but very low volume for phone calls. Sound quality for music is very good. Loudness could have been more , but OK. Noise cancellation is poor.",3
"Good performance ..25hrs playtime most liked thing among all others..lightweight foldable,thumping bass is superb in sound quality,BT connection is easy to connect..noise cancellation is good.",5
This is the for those looking for good bluetooth over-ear headphones in a budget. Everything like build quality to fit to sound is really nice. Only minor drawbacks are a comparatively smaller battery although it's more than enough and a micro-usb port.,5
"It's great headphone, it's having great audio quality even at full volume it doesn't breaks the audio, The Highs, Mids and Bass are very good and clear. But I had problem with the Mic sometimes it didn't work while on calls. Connectivity is good, and comfort is excellent.
I used the headphones with Poco f1.",5
"Overall the quality of the product is amazing... But the thing is that it is not as light as other headphones but it is comfortable and I can use it for hours with out any problem but the noise cancellation is not upto the mark,,,,but I would not recommend you to buy Chinese product...",4
"Recently purchased these headphones. The sound is pretty amazing and so is the noise cancellation. Will update after using it for a while.
Update after using for 2 months- The sound quality is pretty amazing, but I found these headphones bulky, to the point that it starts hurting your ears after a while.
The battery life is too good.",3
Looks Good Sound better and its stilly heavy in the head,4
"Sound quality is good but sometimes I find treble is irritating me but overall good and bass is too good.
I got headphone with logo fire boltt while on Amazon it is showing only boltt on product image.
Second there is no gold plated Jack in headphone instead of this it is silver plated.
And I got the box which is completely damaged but product was ok.",4
Honestly the details of sound is good but bass don't work good in Bluetooth. The built in quality is good comfortable for ears. About the Bluetooth bit a disappointed because even with with 640kbps sound quality I can feel latency and distorted sounds in high volume.,4
I don't know that it don't have return facility . It was my mistake however amazon should have allowed to return. Anyhow product is good as per specifications.,4
The headset feels premium with great Bluetooth connectivity and sound clarity. The aux cable with a mic can be used for wired mode. The mic clarity seems to be good when used with the aux cable compared with the inbuilt mic in Bluetooth mode. I only wish the aux cable length to be a bit more. Great product overall!,4
"Amazing product. Must buy!
Although the review is true, the company asks you to upload positive reviews and take a screenshot and upload it on their site to avail warranty and free stuff. However, u won't b able to upload the pic and hence won't b able to avail any warranty whatsoever!
Nice innovative way to fool people!",5
"Don't go for Fire boltt bluetooth headfone, coz this brand is not worthy at all. I have ordered for this product in June 2021 and received it in time. It has stopped working within two months. Hopeless product.",1
"Product arrived with Headset, Audio and Charging cable. Tested with and without Bluetooth.
Calls are very clear. Music is very good with decent Bass.
Product arrived early than expected.

No Noise cancellation.
Though I am a Prime member, I bought this product for INR 3,300/- during Amazon Great Indian festival. But the very next day price reduced by 300.",4
"The bass is good. I bought it for the bass. Get it for a price of 1799 with an Amazon prime membership. The bass is good. If you have already used 5k or 6k rupees headphones (skull crusher) mainly, don't go for it. You will regret it a little. The packaging experience is the worst in my entire life. Shame really!",4
It has very good sound quality. I liked it very much because either u can use it as wireless or wired. Its very comfortable. For this price I think it worth every penny.,4
"If you are detailed Sound quality listener. Better move to another brand. Headphone does not bear high bass at all, It shivers at high Frequencies. By comfort it's good. Mic is better.
So what, sound quality is bad which makes the product negative.",1
"Headphones quality is very good, sound quality is decent also It gives a decent battery backup. There is a audio lag while using Bluetooth, with 3.5 mm jack it's just fine. The headphones are pretty light and comfortable, thanks to the memory foam cushion they use.",1
"Sound Quality is good enough , but when the product gets damaged or something else , the customer services of the company is terrible ....",2
"one of the ear cup stopped working,
It was under warranty but they did not respond and had extremely bad customer service, product doesn't last long and this company doesn't care about customers",1
"Love these headphones. The build quality is not the best, and I've managed to break the rotating joints of each earpiece multiple times. I basically put them back together using superglue and after reparing them over and over again they've lost the mobility.

Battery life is amazing, sound quality is A1. I wish the build quality was as good.",4
"Received today, pretty solid built, no fuss simple Bluetooth connect (under 2 minutes). Comfy over the head, good sound quality - I had Audio Technica ATH M20x till now before it's wire snapped after a rugged use over 4 years and I decided to buy these bad boys. Best I liked was the easy switch to/from BT to aux. Liked all on day 1.",4
Microphone audio quality is low.. Good for mobility while on any training or while listening to music. But not good for call as the microphone quality is low. Can't be used for calls on your mobile. Price is considered high for this quality.,2
Best product ever in Budget and it also gives us many free of cost useful items.And the battery üîãlife is the best üëçüíØ.These headphones are bass boosted. Very Good Excellent Outstanding headphonesüéß.,5
This a great product at this price range. Sound quality is also at top notch its 40 mm bass boost dynamic drivers also do justice and the material used is also decent the 12 mm aux pin is one of it's special feature as through it you can do sound share I love it all the features are top notch just go for it.,5
"Before i buying this product i pretty excited but after receiving this product totally upset me. Reason because sound latency and normal peace music also added bass...
Conclusion :waste of money to buy this product.... Packing also bad..",1
"The product is unique quality,bass is deep sound and noise cancellation is better good sound ,alone the blutooth 5.0 is very accurate connectivity.so, finally end of the product is perfect in all around sound system .....,but my recommendation is USB type-c fast charging is not .,...but ok overall is perfect product for every one .....",4
"Just got my headphones. It seems to be of good quality though more can be said only after using it thoroughly.
I personally like the sound quality and also the fact that the wireless mode doesn't lag.
I feel the main limitation is the head band which is not that sturdy.",4
It is best product under its price range of you are like me who likes listening to music in full blast this is the headphones for you I am actually impressed by it,5
"Pros: Sound clarity, Aux cable
Cons: Bluetooth range hardly 3 ft, Ear cups not suitable for long hours as it pains",3
"First I thought it would be heavy with the looks, but it is not heavy at all. For me, this is enough, but I wouldn't suggest this to audiophiles.. Bass is ok.. It is like treble and bass are in the same level..",4
"I had very high expectations of the sound quality.
I must say I am disappointed. I bought a another pair of head phones "" one odious people 10R. These are cheaper and the sound quality is better.",2
"Awesome BASS. Had bought a SONY CH510, BOAT ROCKERZ400 but felt the Bass was not upto the expected levels. So returned them and tried this based on the reviews. Product is truly superb. The beats literally vibrate in your ears. Worth the money, just go for it.",5
"Make in India, nice product we should encourage this made in India product, sound quality is superb, must buy product and cheap as compared to other brands",4
Noise cancellation is the key of this headphones üéß and comes with bluetooth 5.0 so there is no issue and these are over-ear headphones which I love the the most with heavy padded for ears and head support overall the sound quality is also decent just a bit heavy.,5
"Exceptional sound, great Bass & superb clarity. A must have for amateur audiophiles like myself. Absolutely loved the sound quality as well as the quality of the product. The build quality makes it feel very sturdy also has a chic look, especially with the Jet Black finish. Would definitely recommend the product to any of my friends. Overall it‚Äôs a great product.",5
"I always wanted an over ear headphones like this. It is very comfortable on the head, ears and also despite having a big bass system it hardly hurts the ear. Enjoying the rock classic bands from early 70s to early 90s and it's awesome. Although have used this for just few days it feels to be promising. Let's come back after few months of use for it's genuine review.",4
The bass is awesome in these headphones. Battery life is also good. the noise cancellation is not very great but good and manageable. The cable is long enough. The bluetooth connectivity is ok as my headphones is not getting automatically connected to my devices as i tturn on the bluetooth. Good for gaming too. I play valorant and used this connected through wire.,4
"The mic was not working in Bluetooth mode. After replacing I got good product. Was unlucky first time. Giving feedback for new product.

Dislike
In Bluetooth mode there is voice sync issue. Which required Bluetooth restart everytime.

Like
The product is great and worth for this price.",4
"The sound quality is best, the bass is also good, its the best product in this price range, I have tried all the headphones in this range and found this best. The only issue is the size, the size of this headphone is larger than other. But the built quality is also good, and for better comfort you need large size.",5
"Bluetooth connectivity have issues when connected yo tv. The sound was breaking for each single dialogue.

Sounds like just a normal headphone. Bass is not that special, now I am doubting all the high rated reviews.

Really disappointed with this purchase.",1
"Fire-Boltt Blast 1400 is nicely built and looks for good quality.
I am seeing Audio issue , kinda echo when talking calls from laptop.

I feel a dedicated mic which can be adjusted would be good addon for office purpose..",4
"Headphone‚Äôs design is cool. Sound and built are on par with other well know brand's products in the price range. I would recommend it if you don‚Äôt want to spend too much just to get a decent sound quality headset. Although I would recommend fir boltt to provide more room in the upper head band, as current size might not fit all people.",4
"The built quality is superb, sound is great, noise cancellation is good, it doesn't get active noise cancellation, didn't expect at this price point, but still does a great job.
Amazing product.",5
"This product just looks good from outside. When I bought this headphones,I thought I have found a jewel seeing the build quality and sound,but sound breaks while connected with Bluetooth. Very bad experience with boultt brand. Not expected this at all from this one as the review was very good. Very disappointing.",1
Just got these today. Sound quality is nice and the aux cable has an inbuilt extra mic. I was assuming that the bluetooth mic won't be good but surprisingly it's working well. It's very comfortable and looks sturdy. Hopefully it'll last long.,5
"For Music stream, watching Movies it is the best
For Gaming its not good at all....
battery backup= Awesome (upto 3 days without charging)
Connectivity= Good
Comfortablilty= can we used upto 1-2 hrs continuously (after that ear becomes hot due to lack pf air contact)",3
"Pro :
-Connectivity..... great
-Comfort....great
-bluetooth connectivity...great
-sound quality ..... great
-volume... great

Con:
Bass heavy so lighter music does not sound well, but overall this difference will be noticeable only to a keen ear.",4
"I like its features.
It has a bit of connectivity issue sometimes but very rarely.
It is light weight and portable
Overall it is very good for its price!",4
"Received today, so far so good. Build quality and sound delivery are up to the mark. No need to worry about battery as it comes with DJ aux cable that gives ~20% more sound than bluetooth.

Product description mentions that it provides Google/Siri Voice Assistance, not able to find it.",5
"I'm writing after the sixth day of it use without charge, battery is at 50 % it's amazing . Noise cancelation great, built strong , comfortable to head . Only problem was didn't got delivered on box but on polyester pack, which I didn't like. Product like this should be delivered on box wrapped.",5
With due respect kindly refund my money and get it back. That is the pathetic items I have ever purchased from Amazon. Within week its going loose from the headphone area. I wanna give it back and want the money back for the same. The bluetooth connectivity is also poor. Color of the headphone is also going.,1
"Best in noise cancellation, real over the ear effect, Superb Base and sound quality. Best part is wired and wireless connectivity, Very happy with this purchase.
Definitely recommend BOLTT Blast 1400 if you are looking for over the ear headphone in this price range",5
"Got the product today, feels very good at the first impression, will add another review after using it for a few days, at this point, feels like it's worth the money!!!!",4
"1. Poor audio quality during video conference and online courses
2. Out side noise can hear while using
3. Earmuffs will not adjust to outside temperature
4. This item is for mentioned below:
- Audio, Video of movies, social media, TV Channels,
- Video conference, Online course",4
The product is good but the packaging that it came in has left me very dissatisfied. I was planning to return it just because of this bus after further checking there was no damage to the product. I REQUEST TO NOT SEND ANY PRODUCT OUT LIKE THIS. Other than that it's a good headphones for this price.,4
Very low quality plastic. Will break within the month.,1
"The headset fits perfectly to my daughter's head. You can expand it as per your head size. Quality if the sound is very clear, I can hear every sound. Bluetooth and wired both are perfect. Especially the feature to link another headphone is beautiful. Great product in this price range.",5
The only reason for returning this is the bluetooth wireless connectivity is not good. If peoples want to use it with wire then they can buy this product.,3
"It's a steal at the price of 2499. The sound quality is best in this segment. The only thing that disappointed me is the frequent reminder of low battery, which beeps after every 3 minutes. Apart from that, this is the best headphones I have purchased in this range.",5
"Nice build, comfortable to wear n use, easy Bluetooth connection and good music quality. This review is after one day of use.. will try to review again later after couple of months may be.",4
"initial impressions after unpacking.
1. sound quality is average and inline with the price range.
2.bluetooth connectivity is awsome and range is great.
3. The wired connectivity is very useful, and a aux to 6mm is great. (also has a 3.5mm jack)
4. comfort is not great to be honest as my years feel hot after couple minutes of use.",4
"The headsets are big in size but very comfortable around my ears. Sound quality is excellent for me when wired or on bluetooth. However I have had complaints when I am on Bluetooth from people on the other end of the call. Apparently my voice isnt very clear and there is too much ambient noise. Surprisingly, none of this matters when I am wired.",4
Everything is perfect except for only one detail and that is the low battery sound....when there is 40% battery left the headphones keep notifying you by playing a beep every 30 seconds. This is the only minus point in this headphone but other than that everything else is perfect.,4
Good sound with a bass effect and battery life approx 20hrs. Could have been better with a carrying case or pouch in folded condition. Cord connection great if battery low or connect direct to device. Overall a good product.,4
"Regret big time buying this headphones. Not worth it. Will never recommend to anyone unless you want to waste your money.

Please check there is no refund, you can only replace the item with absolutely same issues and quality",1
"Great sound quality. Bluetooth connectivity felt easy. Product build looks amazing. I felt like I took a risk with a brand not too well-known, but ultimately it paid off.
There seems to be too much flexibility though which feels a little unnecessary. But it fits perfectly though.",4
"I have a couple of headphones and earphones of various brands. I wanted one over-ear headphone for calls.

Wired connection worker fine same cannot be said about Bluetooth as occasional stuttering is there. I can live with that. Can't expect all everything under the Sun at this price band. happy with the purchase.",4
"Seriously , this is another level , bass is damn good , it ll vibrate for every single beats , eargasm for every song , I never expected this much but it's worth more than 3.5k ,simply damn good sound quality for high and low beats also , sound is so clear , if you buy , you ll amaze , like me , so good ,",5
"Adds a statement to the music you listen. As of now it is working okay. Design and comfort is perfect, wish electronic components were as versatile as the other components of the headphone. Most evolved version of headphone till date as far as I am concerned.",5
"One of best headphones I've owned yet, good sound quality (especially the bass) had some problems with bluetooth connectivity. Although the music quality differs a bit when used via aux wire and blutooth. This was a gift. Overall, Everything was accurate as per product description.",5
 Sound stuttering and breaking. Definitely something is wrong with their bluetooth. Every other bluetooth headphones/speakers are working fine with my laptop . But not this one.,1
This product truly lives upto it's standard. Noise cancellation is upto the mark. Sound quality is good... Can't complaint. Bluetooth connectivity is flawless. It got connected in seconds with my One plus 5T.,5
"The product overall is good.Good bass,sound clarity and design
In terms of size,its a bit small in case u have a big head.
The cushioning is very soft,need to check on long term usage.
Other than that product is good price to value",4
"After using it for 3 months only i found out that the battery is not charging
It says that it‚Äôs charged but when I use it only stays for less than 10 minutes
Right now I will try to replace it as it has 1 year warranty i hope the company will help me out to replace this one as it has battery issues",3
"Just got the product value for money, good choice to buy..

Premium headset with complete package",5
It's fits comfortably. Built feels premium. The battery is awesome . Nothing bad about this product except it still uses micro usb instead of c type for charging and noise cancellation is not completely present . Happy with the purchase,5
"It does not have noise cancellation but noise isolation. Works pretty well. The sound is flat leaning and the headphones are quite comfortable to wear. Overall, a solid headphone for this budget.",4
"It's amazing ..every beat is so clear and u wil feel that you are in disco bar with amazing sound system ....the battery life is also mind-blowing..when I got this fire bolt 1400 headphone yesterday morningI have not charged it even one time ...n iam listening continuously and battery has still 80,% battery ...",5
"The product is pretty good,sound quality and it's comfortable as well. But after a month of using it ,I realised something moving in my left ear cup . It hasn't tampered with the sound but it's concerning because clearly have no idea what is moving inside it,could be the poor handling of the Amazon employees of the product.",4
The headphones üéßüòç are really awesome. They are just like superb thunder bass and has a very clear audio. The noise isolation is passive and the battery life is really incredible. Love It. Worth it's price and go for it without further deeds.,5
"Excellent product.
After doing a lot of research, zero down on this. I was a little pesimestic before ordering but then thought of giving it a try..
Trust me connectivity, music, BASS 5out of 5

Word to describe : Excellent",5
"Best product in this price range. I would say base isn't thumping one. But some people like me may like it. Ear cups may get little hot for a longer period of time. I havent tested the battery life yet, but I would definitely update it here.",5
Like honestly I paid so much and I expect very best but u guys have delivered me damage box . At first the product seem good so I was ready to neglect the packing damage but now the headphones are faulty like seriously I can hear music from only one side !!! I demand to look and matter and give me perfect item .,2
"This headphone is really good and no pain in the ear after wearing it for a long time, daily i m wearing this headphone for around 6-8 hours in my meeting calls. Also the bass is very good I will say above the normal expectations you will feel it. Overall from my side this headphone is best in it's price range please look for some offers it will help you.",4
"This is fantastic product but i have given 4 points because in my opinion its 4 but it is very very good product
If you are thinking that you should buy or not i am telling that u should go for it
Its charge is fantastic the change last for 5-6 days if you use 3 hpura daily also",4
The left cup had a crackling noise during initial use. The left earcup of the headphones had a piece dangling inside it. This has happened twice for me. The customer care offered passive help. I enquired if this is the same for all the devices. But no appropriate response.,3
I really like the audio quality of the headset speaker and the comfort of the neckband. The is mild and loud doesn't make headache or pain in the ears for a long hour of usage. The 3.5 mm jack enables the use of the headset in low battery situations. A lot better than ordinary neckbands.,4
"Overall good product ,good sound quality , great base , surround sound which helps in gaming . I have been using it from last 7 months . Really good product and build quality is also good and the cushions are also good . I am now having issue with the sound with wired mode . Hope the company will soon help me .",4
Do not buy this product. There is no way the glow light are working as they promised. We can't activate the glow lights from anywhere and they don't glow by its own. I have tried hard but couldn't find how the lights work. They are cheating by selling it showing glow lights,1
"Great product with very good quality material used in this headphone. Cushions are rely soft so for long time use.
Sound is really very good and all vocals are clear.
Battery backup is really very good in this price. Almost 1 week used but still not charged and battery is still present. So very nice at this price ..",5
"Sturdy head band. Very loose rotating ear cups is irritating. Head band is best suited for flat wide headed folks. Does not fit over my head properly, the top band presses against the top of my head. A little curvature on this band would have been easier on the fit. Ears get warm/sweaty because material covers ears",2
"Packing was good. Product arrived in good shape and on time. Audio quality is very good. It has about 90% noise cancellation, which was a nice surprise. Microphone voice quality was good. Battery was 100% charged when the product was unpacked. Overall a very happy feeling. Good value for money üëç",5
"AMAZING! After trying and having to return two different headphones, I tried this and oh my god this is so much better. The bass is crisp and clear but not overpowering the treble. Very balanced sound. Passive noise cancellation is amazing. It's incredibly comfortable! The padding is really very soft and does not pain at all!",5
"Good product recommend to use

But they have clause where they force you ( even if you are not willing) to claim something as basic are warranty.... This is pressurizing customers against their will , there is difference between requesting and pressurizing please take care of this :(.!!

Product is good but these ethics arent",5
most qualities are nice but i would say about cons so that brand work on it...vocal need to be increased by 20%-30% for same bass intensity...if different persons have different taste then an app should be developed like sony did so that we can adjust bass mid tones and low tones as per our taste...,4
"Faced many issues when connected with Bluetooth, person on other end of call was not able to hear me properly, replacement headphones did operate in same fashion.",3
 Whatever they've told everything is there. So crisp sound quality. Not for the bass lovers. But decent music clarity. Every voice you can hear clearly. Love the product.,5
This product fits well. It does some level of noise cancellation. But sound quality is not up to the mark or even does not do any justice to the name of this headset. The name Blast sounds really funny once you start using this headset.,3
This product was amazing and price is little bit higher but for this price we are getting best product I‚Äôll give 20/10 review I love it . The quality of the product is also very premium and as compared to jbl and Bose it was better I‚Äôll recommend this for who are thinking to use premium headset better go for this .,5
"Good sound. Wireless and Wired mode. Bit big over the ear. Noise cancelation is fine. Fits the ear well, and is comfortable. Decent purchase at this price. Added gift vouchers and warranty was provided too.",4
"I returned this headphone due to its incompatibility with Amazon firestick (continuous disturbance in audio due to interference). Otherwise with all other devices audio quality was great. Material quality, design, look all very good. Bluetooth range is a little issue, signal weakens for little more than 5 meter distance.",3
"Thumping bass, crystal clear sound, ultra soft design with good built quality. Truly a good product to buy. Sound quality is so good. Though design is not that attractive as compared to other headphones but it is so durable. And Yes! These headphones will perfectly fit to your ears and head due to the adjustability.",4
The battery life is very impressive of this headphone I could use these for more than a week as I m not a heavy user and the thing I didn't liked is when at high volume there is little distortion in the sound and also the charging speed is a bit slow and I missed the type c port,3
I like the sound quality nd the noise cancellation feature of it. Along with th that its fitting nd give more comfort while running. The only thing is concern is sometimes it does connectivity issues and cut sound issues come across when I use to connect with laptop Bluetooth. But overall its really amazing product.,4
Very nice Headset. I am already using Bose Quiet Comfort II. Comparing to that bluetooth signal connectivity is good. Battery backup and Noise cancellation also very good.. But the microphone usage is less audible,5
"First impressions: pretty solid and well built headphones.....they fit perfectly and have a good seal around the ear. The paddings are soft and comfortable. One thing to note is the audio on bluetooth is somehow better than wired in the lows.

Worth the money.....for now.",4

"Pros:
- perfect fit
- least weight in this price range
- good battery backup
- wired/wireless support
- multi device connection at once
Cons:
- sound leakage
- sound crack after vol->80(laptop) on bluetooth
- range of bluetooth less",3
"To submit for warranty we have to submit the screenshot of product review , which is a cheap way to increase review . Other than that the product is good. But the packaging is very bad.",4
"Noise cancelation is good. Bluetooth connectivity was not up to the mark.any abstruction with in 10 meters ,it wouldn't work properly.
Bass is great .treble can be better .but there is lag when playing video on mobiles.
Not sure of I csn use siri on android phone .",3
"The sound quality is good. The device seems sturdy and it is comfortable to wear. The Bluetooth connectivity is fine.

But there is a problem during calls, especially with the aux cable connected.

Yet to check the battery life and mic quality.

Have to wait and see how durable it is.",4
"I received faulty headphone bolts 1400 I reached bolt support , asked me to mail them the issues with headphone again asked to reach support page again they are not reliable bad product will not recommend this company products",1
This is really a nice product at affordable price with good and soft material. Which you can wear for hours.,4
"Very dissatisfied with the product.i bought
It two times 1st time I could not hear sound from left ear plug üòí and at second time I bought it could not connect to Bluetooth.
Please fix your things üôèüôè and check out before you send",1
The battery life is absolutely amazing lasting upto 4 days with moderate usage and sound quality is good. Would recommend everyone to buy this product,5
"So far good they have provided boltt app membership, gaana membership for 3 months and bookmyshow voucher.
However they are forcing me to write a review to get my membership of gaana for 3 months lets see what happens.
Will update the status in few days.",4
"Overrated product on amazon not so good quality audio but just okay.
The worst thing in this headset is mic. that captures the sound of surroundings.
The product range should be in‚Çπ1.5k to ‚Çπ2k.",3
"Likes : Surround sound, comfortable fit, quality, noise cancelling.
Dislikes : Sound is a bit shrill at highest volume.

Overall : Pretty good at this price. Must buy.",4
Good product. We need to confirm manufacturing country before placing order. As true Indian we may look for Indian options.,4
"High price,. poor mic reception. No external mic provided.
No carry bag / case provided with this product.",1
"Average sound quality, missing bass booster, C type charging, expensive for quality provided compared to available players.
I have returned this product !",1
I wanted a blutooth headphones so that I can watch movies comfortable during night without blasting my speaker and trying hard to read the subs and this one seemed cheap along with the prime sale got it today and it seems to be good will update after a few months of use,4
"The best part of this product is it's sound quality and battery life.
The bass is good enough to get you groovy. 100% recommended.",5
"Waste of money. No noise cancellation and Mic receptor not working .
Other side person not able to hear our voice. So much irritating.
After usage of 2 months am not satisfied with the product.",1
The built is pretty good and they don't seem to be too heavy. You may take some time to adjust to the weight but you will adjust in a day or two. Sound is pretty good. Bass is okay. Overall a good buy under 2500/-,4
"Best product in this range.
Cushions are soft.
Sound is clear.
Fits the ear.
Battery runs above 17 hours.
Aux feature is also great.

Must Buy headphone!!! üëçüéß

After 1 year of use the plastic body starts to break though.",5
Really good headset. Better sound clarity/ battery backup.,5
Recieved this product just now and there are many things in the package i have to explore them more loved the audio quality of headphones best at this price point. I wil do a detail review after a week,4
"After 6 months of usage, the rotating ear pad broken along with wire.

Noise cancellation - 4/5
Sound quality 4/5
Build quality - 1/5",1
I liked the product very much due to it's sound quality. Purchased it to connect with TV to enjoy the same.,5
It is a very good product. It has very good features like google assistant and has a good aux cable which is provided by company. Its sound is also great,5
"Except Noise Cancellation other features are awesome , I purchased it for office purpose.",5
"My Honest review is that at this price range this is one of the best headphones with best sound quality, bass, and noise cancellation
I gave it 4 stars just because it is little small then expected
I also hesitated to buy this but was fully satisfied
I expect that this may help the buyers",4
"Excellant headphone i buy it for my daughter , She is very happy for this , easily adjustable to any head size , great quality, can go for it",5
"I bought this product a while ago, quite impressed by the design and the quality of the product but the only thing I find a little uncomfortable is that, the cushion is a little too much in my case at least and the sound quality is quite good and is comfortable.",4
"Within one month after perchance, one side of the headphones has stopped working completely..... We would like the headphones to be replaced immediately since it is covering under the warranty period..... We would be appropriate your immediate action",5
"Good one üëç for this price

Battery life is good ,looks heavy and perfect
overall 10/10",5
Sound quality is great with Bluetooth and it gets better with the aux cable provided,4
Not at all worth the price tag. Though I understand the reason but Amazon is irritating me. Please do understand the quality of music this product produce is not any near to the price ‚Çπ3500. Yet Amazon does not understand...,1
"Bluetooth connectivity is fine,it has passive noise connection not active but the passive one works fine enough.sound quality is above average bass is medium. The best thing i like about these headphones that they have large in size englulf the ear fully inside.",4
First of most worst product i have ever seen.. built quality is very bad..too much big for ear..even my first order has speaker looses in 10 days then i replace it..but now i think this will also happens same..not 1% satisfied..total waste of money,1
The product is good only for listening to music. not at all good to take calls or attending meetings.,1
This is a really good choice at this price point. The sound is pretty good and the noise cancellation is well due to big ear cups. I have used it for less than an hour but I could already recommend this easily,5
Sound quality was not at all up to the mark and the bass was ok and the worst thing is packaging(shown in the picture) and the material was good and noise cancellation was ok.The look of 6.5mm jack was so gross and the Bluetooth connectivity is good,3
"It does all that has been claimed. Backup time is unbelievable! Amazing sound quality with super bass!
only negative is that it is slightly heavy!",5
Sound quality is okay. Was expecting better experience. Positive reviews found for 3 months Gaana subscription offered with the package.,4
"In terms of delivery, the speed of delivery was very good < 24 hours - Product Quality is one of the best and price in my view is highly competitive.",5
"Cable that comes with the headphones is a little underwhelming, but the wireless connectivity is great. Audio output through wireless is great as well, much better than what was expected for the price. Branding is clean, design is very sleek and the fit is comfortable.
Both audio and look wise, a great pair of headphones.",5
That was really awesome for music on Bluetooth its having an aux cable with it and quality product. But for Bluetooth connectivity for gaming its not if u purchqse is for gaming make sure use aur cable blast bass,5
Suddenly gets disconnected in between . Have to switch off n on to continue,2
The 'True' over the ear design allows better sound quality. Particularly liked the Two way AUX cable option is amazing. The cushioning is great and provides comfort even with long usage. Got this for 2799 during Diwali GIF sale event.,4
"Good product for the value. Bass could have been better

Edit. Bluetooth gives out a weird static noise. I changed the source and yet the issue is not getting resolved. Returning the product.",1
"just a little bulky but is the same as see in pictures, so your call!! otherwise sound is very good, perfect for daily use and comfortable as well, one can have little pain in the beginning on the area where the band rests, but you would get used to it..",4
I bought it last week and the left side was loose and I thought he is about to brake in a day so I returned it and now I m ordering it again.... And got a headset which was opened already and there was some kind of white powder on and had sound delay....,2
"The headphones while they do work, work very well. Very good sound quality, would score high on volume, noise cancellation, bass, and most other sound metrics. However, it seems they're liable to breakdown, and are not very sturdy, as the left earpad which broke, no longer works.",3
"Good headphones, bass not gets distorted even at the vocal bass is in the song, punch bass is also not distorted. Can feel the different bass without even any difference. Perfect headphone for music lovers. Audio gets neat to hear.",5
"Bekaar product hai,Mera headphone kharab nikal gya hai ox lagate hi band ho rha h,40% bettery hone ke baad bhi 10 second me bettery alerts bajane lagta hai baar baar irritation hoti h koi fayeda nhi, online complaint dene ke baad bhi koi reply nhi aaya.",1
"Product is awesome at the price point, i have used boat , sony and realme and all the prices were almost same and about this beast no words left noise cancellation is great , sound quality is tremendious with a thumping bass and battery life is also awesome and also it is comfortable to wear.It also stylish and good looking.Best product at this price.",5
The quality of the headphones is good but the packaging is worst. When I received the product it looks like it was already used .it is like a renewed product.wires should be inside the smaller box which is in the main box but they are outside the small box. Dont order from AYR tech sales.,3
This headphones are pretty nice for this cost the sound quality is good and the charge time is pretty good mic is average but for thdi cost it is super .If anyone want these headphones for gaming or online classes or to watch movies this is the best .,5
"Best product at this price range. High quality louder sound also thumping bass, battery back up is best.",5
Just got it like the build quality. Will revert with my feedback later.,4
"Sound quality is below average for this price . quality is not too good but if you wanna by headphone then buy other at same price I have used around 6,7 headphone but this is the wrost one. It is good headphone but such quality you can easily get in1000rs headphone.",1
"After using for over 10 days, primarily on wired connection it is quite good. I have used it on bluetooth for 3-4 days for around 4 hours each day and haven't charged it even once till now and battery is still 40%. Only problem is it hurts the ears after an hour or two.",4
"The unit I received was defective. With Bluetooth connection, only right speaker was working and with aux cable, only left speaker was working. The packaging was also not proper, seemed like they packed the used unit just for the sake of packaging.",1
After 15 minutes the weight would start to cause massive discomfort. Looks all plastic.,1
AMAZING PRODUCT WITH GREAT QUALITY SOUND AND BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY.I USE TO FOR LISTENING TO MUSIC AND ALSO TAKE MY TEAMS MEETING CALLS FOR HANDSFREE AND NOISE FREE EXPERIENCE.,5
"For a headphones worth this amount, it would be expected to have better quality sound than a pair of headphones that are worth less than half the price. Sadly, that is not the case. Steer clear.",1
The Mic is not working (low voice) on Windows 10 laptop as well as on One plus mobile..Spend significant time on troubleshooting but lo luck so far... planning to return if don't get the solution in next 1-2 days,2
"These headphones have great noise cancellation and no problem with Bluetooth connectivity (Auto-connect). I also liked the option to connect with wires, now I can connect to my pc as well.

These are quality headphones for work from home. Can also pick up and hang up calls.",5
"bluetooth connectivity is good, noice cancelletion also good but sound quality is not better, it is also only good",2
Just purchased it it‚Äôs good product sound is good . It‚Äôs good for hearing music but problem is that it don‚Äôt work that good for YouTube and gaming . I thing you should create some sort of companion app for it so that we could adjust it ourself otherwise it‚Äôs good,4
"First of all it is made in china and the microphone is of no use...moreover if u are spending 3k on a not so famous brand u expect some quality but this was not up to the mark except the cosmetic looks..
Therefore i suggest u to go for a reliable brand not this.",1

The headphone is the best in this price range. The sound quality is amazing. The best feature is that it has two aux ports. It's perfect for those who have trouble connecting this device via bluetooth to their PC. The sound quality is amazing using both bluetooth and aux cable.,5

Tried returning it but the window for return also shut",1

Nose cancelation could be better.,3

"For students who intend to actually take notes don't buy, my tip got frayed within a day's use, this is just a fancy freebie and guess what Samsung does not provide replacement tips like tab S6.
Update
Now the button on S pen is also not working surprise surprise.",1
"Samsung has really hit the Tablet market by adding an S-Pen.
Let's talk about a few aspects of the device.

1) Free S-Pen (5/5) - Throwing a free S-Pen in the box is probably the best thing that Samsung has done in the price range. S-Pen does not need a battery, no pairing needed, and is ergonomically lightweight. The plastic build feels no less than a premium stylus that you can find in the flagship tablets only.
Notes taking is so handy and palm rejection is decent. I am not an artist but I'm sure it won't make much difference for artists as well. It has no lag and the button in the S-Pen is handy too. The synchronization of S pen with the display is seamless. A brilliant add on by Samsung.

2) Display (3/5) - The tablet is surely going to be a drawback with its TFT panel display. The colors aren't rich and not as punchy and vibrant as you might find in most phones nowadays. However, it is better than most Android tablets in the market at this price range. If you are a Super AMOLED Display user like me, then the display is surely going to disappoint you taking you back to the era of 2016-17. Normally, you won't find it much bothering if you aren't constantly gawking for picture quality. It's understandable and decent for the price as far as other aspects are concerned. My main utility is reading and taking notes and I'm totally satisfied with the display panel.
The colors are good and the outdoor usage is also decent.

3) Speakers (5/5) - Loud, Punchy and clearer audio than expected. No wonder why Samsung brands AKG so proudly on its devices.

4) Processor (4/5) - I don't do much gaming and probably wouldn't wish to use a tablet for that purpose. But I tried COD mobile in this anyway and found it run smoothly. Of course, graphics and display aside. The apps launch quite smoothly and I faced NO LAG in any app till now. In fact, some video editing tools work fine as well.

5) OS (4/5) - This tablet comes with Android 10 and supports all that you find in the app store. The best thing about Android is that its wide range of applications and most of them are free. Of course, not all of them are optimized for tablets, but there's no reason to complain. Almost all apps run as smoothly as they do on any mobile phone. Although you can find apps that are specially optimized for Android tablets as well. I personally find Android 10 OS much rational, especially in the price range even if I compare it with its rival windows 10 OS in Surface Pro.

6) UI (5/5) - Samsung, nowadays is taking up the market with its One UI and the new update makes the user experience better with buttery smooth theme and gestures. It works no less amazing in the tablet and gives a pretty good experience while using it. BUT, it does make you feel like using a Samsung phone, just that with a bigger screen and its quite alright.

7) Camera (3/5) - Well, The 8 MP rear camera is pretty decent and gets the work done. The 5 MP front camera is good as well and is quite ok with video calling, online lectures, and similar purposes. Don't expect to do a session of photography with it. Although Samsung came up with better camera quality than most Android tablets in the price range. Camera Megapixels and quality should not be a major deciding factor in terms of a tablet, anyway.

8) Connectivity (5/5) - No complaints at all. One can connect any Bluetooth device seamlessly, be it a keyboard, mouse or BT speakers and the range is good as well.

9) As a laptop replacement: BT keyboards and mouse can be integrated to give it a laptop feeling. But frankly, If you want a laptop, buy a laptop. As simple as that. There's no point in replacing a laptop with a tablet. I bought a tablet for instant access to the internet, journals, papers, reviewing presentations, a little entertainment, meetings, and notes taking. And I'm so much satisfied with it. For heavy professional work and all, I have a laptop for that.

Overall Review: This is the best deal you could get especially with the S-Pen integration and if you dont want to spend an extra 6000 to 9000 INR just for a stylus. Probably very good for students in the price range, mainly in the times of online classes and lectures. It is an awesome tablet for others as well.

I could recommend it to everyone. I hope this review helps.",4
"Simply worth the money

Review written after one day of use :-
Pros
1. Value for Money with S-pen
2. s-pen works like a dream
3. No lag during gaming
4. Handles multi task well
5. Hand writing recognition is awesome and no lag in pen
6. Best for studying and note taking
7. Decent Camera

Cons
None that I faced other than S-pen doesn't stick well on left side

My purpose of buying this was studying and reading PDF book with light gaming and Entertainment for that it is best.

I saw some questions about not being able to avail pre book offer so
1. Samsung shop can be downloaded from galaxy store only on tablet
2. Offer banner will appear within 72 hours of tablet activation so don't panic if it doesn't appear right away",5
"This is my first bad experience with a product I bought from Amazon. They have always been very prompt in their service and response time
However this time, I don't know what happened

I am not getting any response from Amazon as well. Waiting calls for half hour. Then line goes dead and there are no callbacks

PRODUCT ISSUE
When I opened the box, I found that the S Pen is frayed at tip. It doesn't work properly and you have to press it hard on the screen to get it to work
Also there are no replacement tips
Not sure if Samsung has done this purposefully just because of the lite tag

I just want a replacement for the S pen or replace the tab or return the item and get a refund.",1
"this is a mind blowing tablet and i did 't expected it to be such a beast, before buying this tablet i was really confused b/w this tab and the ipad 10.2, i saw many reviews on youtube and most of them told that the screen is a let down due to the LCD panel but anyway i m kinda samsung fanboy and generally hate apple product because i think they are generally not worth it according to the price so i ordered this tablet and recieved it just 3 hrs ago and my my the screen is so mesmerizing it doesn't even feel like an LCD panel and its so crisp! and the sound is like i m in a theater, the s pen is smooth as hell. One thing i didn't like is the camera quality as its very pixelated and didn't impressed me much but i don't mind it as tablet is not meant for photography but it does its job of scanning QR codes and documents. I have drawn a quick sketch in autodesk sketchbook as its my first digital drawing its not so good but it will give you an idea about the s pen accuracyüòÅ

UPDATE: After using the tab for 3 days now i experienced some CONS that i would like to mention-
1)tablet being having an LCD panel, it becomes very difficult to use during night time because its ""minimum brightness"" is still bright and dark mode doesn't help much.
2) processor is little weak in terms of gaming but other then gaming its all smooth.
3) the spen is great and can be easily compared with the apple pencil or may be we can call it better as this stylus is made by wacom company who are expert in making digital stylus its latency is even better then the original tab S6 pen BUT one problem with this pen is that its nib cannot be replaced and once it will break the whole stylus will be useless, so we have to really use it carefully....if you are a heavy user of s pen then i will recommend you to pick up an another backup stylus though most of the android supporting stylus are crap but i found 2 good stylus:
1) Staidler noris digital pencil( its specially made for samsung tablet and it has all the function of spen including the palm rejection) cost- 3500/-approx
2) Adonit jot pro(its more of a budget stylus but does all the job of spen but doesn't have the paƒ∫m rejection) cost-1200/- approx.
4)In malaysia samsung is giving free targus keyboard book cover worth rupees 7000 with this tab and in our country there's not even a single freebie provided this is just rediculous and unfair.
so these are all the CONS that i experienced though i loved the tablet and from day 1 of its arriving i m glued to this tablet(haha) and continuosly sketching on autodesk, here's my another digital art i tried(spend 10+hrs on drawing this candle)",5
"UPDATE: Latest software update : 1. Brightness can now finally be reduced to a level which doesn't strain eye
2. Double tap to wake feature here now.
3. Improved camera performance.

Its been 10days since im using the tab...I am a student who writes a lot of notes, have a huge bunch of pdf books, watch my classes, netflix, prime etc.. I owned apple iPAD PRO 1st generation from past 3 years with apple pencil 1st gen and didnt want to spend much this time...i was confused between ipad 10.2 7th gen and tab s6 lite...i went for this...n im loving this...im glad i made the right choice.
Im will compare it with ipad(which i used personally) and tab s5e(my brother has it) as well...

PROS:
1. S-pen: the BEST STYLUS in market for me right now...it is very light, long, the tip is really nice and with added spen functionality like in GALAXY NOTE devices...its the best way u can interact with your tablet in entire market.
‚Ä¢ It sticks perfectly to side with really tight magnets (as long as you dont place it on volume rockers which some stupid reviewers do and say magnet is bad)
‚Ä¢ Almost no latency while using Samsung Notes , Squid or OneNote.
‚Ä¢ Luckily no need to charge the bettery which is really nice to have.
‚Ä¢ Transparency, smart select, translation, penup and other features works just like charm‚ù§. Great to have it(none in ipads)
‚Ä¢ Button: can be used to quickly erase what you wrote by either double tap or by holding it(absent in apple pencil gen1). Also you can toggle the quick settings with it.
‚Ä¢ Matt texture, and non slippary (unlike apple pencil gen1). Feels like a real pencil in hand.
Ive used apple pencil 1st gen from past 2 years...its super heavy and slippary(due to its glossy coating), the weight distribution sucks, charging method is very very horrible and after 1.5 years the battery in pencil deteriorated considerably. Also there is no place to stick the pencil unless you buy a separate cover, feels like writing on glass which isnt best handwriting at all.
In short Spen absolutely blows away apple pencil gen1.
2. DISPLAY: yes it is a tft display n not amOLED...but do not forget that it is made by world's best smartphone display maker company...the display is super sharp and vibrant and you cant tell by mere looking at it that its not OLED unless you place it side to side with tab s5e with oled screen..its really great for the price considering the laminated display with almost no gaps between screen and display like in apple ipads.
3. PERFORMANCE: i was very very afraid on as to how the performance would be considering its an exynos 9611...but its actually really good..if not great(bec of the price).
Pubg works perfectly great on high graphics, high frame rates with almost no jitters, so does call of duty.
Compared to tab s5e...which is thought to be faster...but its not...as its exynos...samsung can configure the apps axcording to their chip just like what apple does...so performance is literally almost the same on both tab s5e and tab s6lite...
Also in a review on youtube...as compared to ipad 7th gen...it was able to load the apps at same speed...obviously if you only want to game then ipad is better option but still this does the job just fine.
4. SOFTWARE: runs on android 10 and one UI2.1 which is very polished...i just love oneUI and associated features and customisations.
Compared to tab s5e, you can get an extra 1 year of software update according to samsung 2 year policy.
5. SPEAKERS: i like to play stuff directly on tab...n oh boy these speakers are the best...yes they are just 2 but when compared to tab s5e with 4 speakers they sound the same ...and with ipad pro 1st gen...these 2 AKG with dolby atmos stereo speakers outwieghs the 4 of my previous ipad's which was a surprise package for me as well.
6. HEADPHONE JACK: i hate what smartphone companies have done to the headphone jack...not even samsung has started ditching it BUT luckily its still here...which is a blessing for me.
7. PRICE: cheapest and most complete note taking tablet at this price.
8. Type c jack: comes with amazing functionality...can connect pen drives, mouse, keyboard and anything that you want.(literally i couldnt do anything with my ipad pro 1st gen with lightening connector)

CONS:
1. Though the display is good and bright...but it lacks geting the lowest possible brightness levels ...which is still pretty bright for night use
2. Aspect ratio ...i still would prefer my old ipad's 4:3 aspect ratio for reading my books, writing notes. Yes this is better for watching movies and videos but for me i missed it.
3. No DEX...i dont know buy why there is no dex here...yes we can open the apps in floating windows but dex is all together the best thing...its there in tab s5e by the way.
4. No fingerprint scanner... this is the most annoying this about this tablet...though the facial recognition is superfast and snappy. But at night or for better protection it should have had it...(present in s5e)
5. No extra tips for spen included in box.
6. No fast charger out of box though it supports fast charging.

So, to some up...this is the best note taking tablet you can buy right now at just 30k (apple ipad 7th gen would cost 40k with sucker apple pencil gen1 and lesser storage and s5e misses the spen which is best stylus ive ever used.)
If you can not buy iPAD PRO 11"" with apple pencil gen2 which is still THE BEST tablet in market and your budget is tight...GO FOR TAB S6 LITE WITHOUT EVEN THINKING AGAIN.
I absolutely loved what samsung has offered this time at such a great price. (n im glad i didnt go for ipad 7th gen.)",5
This tab came with pre launch offer where galaxy ear bud + can be purchased at 2999. But unfortunately this offer I am not able to get as amazon days its offer from partner brand and Samsung is not responding on this ..Feel cheated by amazon ad campaign,1
"First of all things it does better than iPad 7th gen..
1. S pen included, you don‚Äôt have to shell out additional 8 k (but note that Apple Pencil performs far better)
2. Better aspect ratio..
3. Better speakers..sound is amazing...
4. Extra slot for memory card...
5. Flexibility of Android...

Now where it lags compared to iPad
1. The screen is so much better in iPad ..
2. The productive apps like GoodNotes, notability, procreate, lamafusion have no replacement in android
3. The smoothness of iOS is unparalleled...

Final thoughts...
If you can stretch your budget go for iPad... if only interested in light use and general entertainment purpose ..this one is good.. just keep your expectations low...",3
"I have just received the Tab S6 lite and man it looks good. Compared to the basic Ipad, it looks wayy better. Loving it as of now.
Only one complaint, the pen that came with it has its tip a little worn off. I'll take it to the repair center to see what can I do.
Else everything is great.
Will keep updating it in the future.",5
"Received the tab today. Here are my observations.

In terms of build quality and looks, it looks good.

For me the s-pen was all over the place. As soon as I bring it closer to the screen, it starts registering touches even though its 1 cm apart from the screen. This results into undesired touches and actions being performed every where. My main reason of ordering the tab was due to the pen support, but this s-pen is completely useless for me. Tried contacting the Samsung support over whatsapp, all the guy can tell ,e was to factory reset the tablet or go to customer center. Being in Mumbai, the Corona capital of India, I will go for returning the tablet instead.

Also if there is anything being written to the storage, like an app being upgraded or something getting downloaded, then device gets really slow.

Final con, like many other, I am also not able to claim the pre-book offer. Says invalid serial number

Edit:

Increased my rating as I got few things sorted.

S-pen started working after I attached it couple of times to the magnetic side of the tab i.e. below volume buttons. Also pre-order offer got activated after two days of delivery",4
 started giving problem of hanging after few days.. screen frequently becomes unresponsive. and received damged s pen,1
"Good alternative for i pad ! Will update if I face any issue.
Packing was poor..

Regarding Pre-booking offer-
After 72hr of activation of tablet in for you section of SAMSUNG SHOP I found tab s6 lite pre-book banner after cliking on that I was directed to web page where I entered my mo no and serial no after that I got promo code via text message. Which I used while checking out GALAXY BUDDS+ and as SAMSUNG promised I got GALAXY BUDDS+ @ 3k
Note- ( Samsung shop was download from samsung's GALAXY STORE)

Update 1-
some time s pen dont work on edges of screen. But its not big deal because its depends upon aap support. Also i have seen that in one note when you write stroke of writing is thinner towerds edges and it get thicker in middle. But with other aaps like s note i havent seen this problem. ( After 2 days of use I think this is happening due to tablet cover still not sure)

Update 2-
Use s pen very gently otherwise when you press it hard nib of s pen get stuck inside and you need to strech it out thankfully i had nib remover of huion graphics tablet so i managed ( in such case you can use any other object like nail cutter but handle nib very gently.)

Update 3-
Some times s pen dont work. Initially i thought that its happening due to software but nothing to do with software its happening due to poor build quality of s pen need to tap on side of s pen hardly to get it into work. (When it in working condition it works fine) But some time it didn't probably its happening with my s pen only.
Update 4-
As mentioned in update-1 and uodate-4 problems s pen was not working properly near the right and left edges of screen Also the S pen had few issues so I returned the tablet and thinking to buy same another one bcz what samsung is providing with in 28k is good enough for my uses. Cross figures and hopefully I will not face same issue with my next tablet.",5
"Ordered 25th June and Received 30th June and the product malfunctioned within 27 Days of usage i,e Today 26 July. If I lived in USA I can claim Amazon Replacement policy but here I'm unfortunate as I'm Amazon India Buyer.
The Problem is Tablet is completely unusable - It continuously pressing Back keys in portrait mode of its own and in Landscape Mode it continuously pressing Home + Back Button.
I was watching a live session on YouTube in Landscape mode and the TAB is held by a tablet stand on the Desk that is the only program running at that time suddenly YT's Progress bar keeps appearing with play pause button - Looks like somebody pressing my tab, after some time it minimises and then the app shut off itself....now in that mode at the bottom of the screen Home+Back continuously pressed of its own...I can't open any program all getting closed and tabs heat up. I can't even shut down the TAB.
That is it......So far done 2 times Factory Reset and countless time of reboot / shut down (which is very hard because continues back button pressed) but Tablet remains the same.
What a piece of garbage Samsung Produce I don't know. 27 Days 27999/- Gone vanished in Air. Service Center is far from my house and COVID Lockdown in place, No Public Trasport and Nearest SVC remain shut indefinitely.",1
"I expected something great as i pre- ordered this product 10 days prior to launch i was excited , but on true noyes its not worth its price tag , screen is hmvery hard to use in day light or of any light reflextion is there.
Customer support denied to return the product even after 10 days return guarantee. Pathetic experience .

Buy it only , if you want to use it in dark.",1
"Got a broken tip of the S penin the box.
No replacement tips
Dissapointed
Though the overall tab is fabulous.",1
"S Pen broken:
I have received a faulty s-pen. The nib is frayed and does not glides smoothly on the screen. The tab is fantastic but the spen is why I bought it. I ignored few of the reviews here saying that they have recieved broken spen and went ahead with the purchase. But alas! I have recieved a damage product.
I kindly request Amazon to provide replacement for the spen or the tablet as a whole",1
Everything seems good until you start charging this tab. It takes almost 3.5 hours to get charged completely. And secondly there are no extra tips available for s pen with this tab as they are available for other products. It can support Upto 15 watt charger but the charger provided with this product is only 7.5 watt.,1
"TL;DR: Probably the best tablet in the market for students right now

=====Pros=====
- Stylus included: Major bonus for note taking; costs 8-9k for the competitor brand

- Laminated screen: makes the writing experience equal to the pro devices

- Looks: Same as the tab S6, can't tell the difference from far, hence a very premium look and no big bezels

=====Cons=====
- The OS: Wait, I'm a big fan of Android but the iPadOS has some really nice apps that were made specifically for iPads and that just isn't the case here but there are a few promising apps in early stages like Noteshelf, Krita, etc.

- Camera: Poor in comparison to the quality available in phones today but good enough for video calling/taking images of paper documents. It isn't that big a deal cause I don't think anyone would be taking pictures outdoors on a tablet anyway

There isn't any lag with multiple apps running in split window and hence the TFT display and the slightly inferior processor doesn't matter much for me personally but might for someone who's into intensive gaming but to them I tell go grab an S5e! (has everything superior but no stylus)

All in all, if you're a student and don't have tons of cash to burn/wait in uncertainty for 5 months till the next new budget iPad but want to study like a pro right now, it's highly recommended you to get this tablet.",5
"Pros -
Display- Not an Amoled panel but the display is miles better than the iPad 7th gen and the resolution is such that videos take up the entire screen enabling a great viewing experience.
Spen - Great to use, comes included and has a lot of features.
Battery - Have been getting around 10-11 hours of screen on time which is absolutely insane.
Audio - Dual speakers with Akg tuning is excellent .
Cons-
Spen magnetically attaches but mainly to the back which isn't feasible when resting the device, side attachment is weak.
Only samsung flip case available at the moment which is extremely expensive.
Power on off button is placed a bit too high.
Some apps aren't optimized .
Processor is fine for most tasks but not great at gaming.
Verdict -
Overall a great product in this price segment and surely is worth the money.",5
"The day I received the package I realized that the Spen do not work properly, it starts writing before the nib touches the screen. This means between alphabets/ words it leave a trail of line.. So, the Spen is useless. Informed the Amazon about replacing the product. They informed that a service guy will visit and take an assessment. The first service guy never visited but filed his report that everything is fine!! the guy cheated!!! the next person came and he had no technical knowledge to understand what the problem with Spen I was facing with. He also filed the report that the Spen is working fine. I called the customer service for the third time and pleaded with them to connect to the higher authority. After talking the customer service head for half an hour I realized that Amazon has no plan to stick to their policy of return within 7 days!!! In US or Europe this return policy is taken very seriously. There the Customer is treated with respect.
Now, I am stuck with a Samsung S6 product worth 28000 Rs and I am not able to use this for writing notes/teach
Looks like Amazon has no respect for their customers from INDIA.",1
5 stars for tab and 0 stars for Samsung India . Don't buy this tab if you will be using mainly spen . The major problem is the spen comes with black nib which is soft and wears out quickly . And also there are no replacement nibs when enquire with Samsung support they said only solution is to buy a new spen which costs more than 2k . So Everytime a nibs wear out we have to replace the whole pen but it in all other countries replacement nibs are available . It's like they are forcing us to buy new spen Everytime instead providing replacement nibs which would merely cost not more than 100 or 200/-,1
"Works fine but is quite expensive for this configuration. Samsung M31 phone with far better configuration (8GB RAM, 128GB storage, 6000mA battery) and far superior camera of 48mp costs 19k. This has bigger screen with only WiFi (LTE costs 4k moe) and M31 has dual sim. Bought it primarily for reading. S Pen looks delicate, not sure how long it will work. It doesn't has fast charging either with 7000mA battery nor it has flash.",1

"Never buy Samsung products getting in trap of jaw dropping offers. It's my personal experience. I tweeted ,messaged them ,called them but they are just giving lame excuses for proving me not eligible for the offer which were not even mentioned in the terms and condition brochure! Very poor service by Samsung I just hope they get well soon.",1
"Okay so here is the review after 4 months.
Pros.. 1. Cheaper alternative for ipad. If you are student it's for you.
2. Speaker quality is awesome and I can't complain for a better display in this price range. Perfect for online class (or marrow or prepladder @medicos )
3. S pen included. So perfect for note taking. S pen featured withing this Price range is too good to be true.
4. If you are a reader and going to buy this for study purpose battery life is way beyond your need.

Cons-
1. Packaging of s pen. Check previous reviews... Most of their s pen tip was damaged. This is due to packaging of the s pen by Samsung it self. In the box s pen is just wrapped by a small sleeve and can easily move to and fro while shipping, causing damage to the tip.
2. Clearly not for premium gaming experience. This Exynos processor can handle pubg but at this price range you can expect more
3. Display. As you all know Samsung does not provide their flagship display here in this budget.
4. Easily damaged s pen tip.
If you write with pressure.. This s pen is not for you.
5. Expected faster refresh rate at this price range",4
"I bought this tab for notes + reading purposes
And it is excellent so far, s-pen is way batter compared to s6's pen, run smoothly while taking notes,TFT display is also gorgeous, battery back is so far good actually.
Seems like samsung really taking tablet market seriousl, and one ui is just so damn good, too many features, loved the s-pen's inbuilt notes app, overall it's a good alternative for low budget ipad,if you have android phone and u have paid apps, I would suggest go for this, worth buying",5
The pre booking redemption advertised with samsung s6 lite is not at all availabe,1
Spen is damaged. Package is damaged. Tab is heating up on moderate use. Seems to be an used product.,1
Very bad experience purchasing this tablet. The tablet doesn't work and the pen is not at all working. On top of it the amazon team is not supportive at all in this product. The technical team visited to check the tablet and couldn't solve it.. Rather than taking back the faulty product amazon makes you talk to different teams to waste your time without accepting their fault. Very bad experience.. Never going to buy any electronic products from amazon after this,1
 Product is completely new and is defective. It is showing unexpected behavior. Technician is going to visit to validate. Will update further later.,1
"Please go for iPad. Don't waste your money on this stupid Exynos powered thing. Trust me, iPads are 100 times better than these. Go for iPad 7th Gen or iPad Air.",1
" Attaching the screenshot and Videos.
Immediately after opening the box I've observed white lines and blurring of screen .
But after some time I found repeatedly this faulty is getting and then I reported to customer care about this issue.
He said me to send photo or video , and I'm waiting for my replacement
Plz do justice for my money plz Amazon.

Update : I've recieved a replacement for the defective tab and got the new one which got manufactured on aug itself.

Battery is very good , you can watch 7-8 movies easily for one charge.

Touch experience is smooth.

Weight is a bit heavier (may be bcoz I'm first time user of tab)

S Pen nib/tip is useless , it will be worn off in a month for heavy users.

Speakers are awesome.

I don't play games , so couldnot review on performance.",3
"I bought this mainly for watching movies and some productivity stuff like using spreadsheets and online classes for my son who is in class 12. I am not a gamer at all. For my use it's good. (My son prefers his phone for games, not a bulky tablet)

The pen is a nice add on and at times I find it easier to compose long emails by writing rather than typing! I don't know if the pen is durable, though.

The speakers are awesome and watching movies is a pleasure.

I have one small complaint, though. Samsung has tried to reduce the bezel size but in order to hold it comfortably we end up placing our fingers on the screen area. When I read Kindle books, the page goes on flipping even if I don't intend to. It is a little uncomfortable to hold and read books in the absence of a bigger bezel.

The tab is a little slippery and you might want to purchase a flip cover cum stand to carry it around.

The face unlock is nice but at times takes more time to recognise your face and you might end up unlocking with your pattern before it recognises you.

The camera is ok, but my phone's camera is better and I know that if I want to take pics, I will prefer using my phone, so that's fine. It serves the purpose of showing your face to the teacher during online classes and taking photos of your home work and uploading it to Google Classroom or whatever platform your school/college uses.

I have used Lenovo tab earlier and it was dead slow. Wouldn't allow me to work with spreadsheets or even have 3 chrome tabs open. So I had to sell it and buy this one. I am happy with the performance of my S6 lite.

I also got the news that Samsung will provide Android updates for a minimum of three years for a few devices including S6 lite, so that's another plus point and makes this worth the price of 29K I paid for it. (Got a credit card discount)",4
"I'm giving this review after using it for a week. I can't decide if I'm happy with the product or not. Before making the purchase too, i went through the reviews and there quite a few mentioning the bent S- Pen tip . Despite of all those reviews, I dared to purchase it. Finally i got the same kind of S-pen with uneven tip. I can't say it's damaged or something. Because, it's working fine. But, it's kind of makes me feel bad that despite all the money I've spend on this, am receiving such product. If u want to purchase, buy at your own risk.",3
S- pen tip chipped off. Box looks old,1
I preordered the tablet and after waiting a long time I received the product on jul 18. Initial impressions were really good. The tablet has covered all the basic things I wanted and had a certain major issue. S pen was defective. I thought it was a software issue but noticed it was bent. Realized the QA team didn‚Äôt do a great job in checking the product. Since there was no stock available I had to return the product.,2
The prebook offer mentioned in the description does not seem to be valid. Unable to get the coupon as it says the serial number specified is not valid for the offer. Had to follow up and chase up with Samsung to finally reach the right team and then managed to get the coupon,3
"Product looks and works well. However, there are a few non-product related issues. one, the product pack was not shrinkwrapped. Two, while setting up the device I noticed that the Google play store location was set to the Ukraine. had a hard time changing that. Three, apparently my product serial number is not eligible for pre-booking offer! Tried to reach out to Samsung but due to c-19 you can only talk to a smart assistant. And finally, there's no return only replace. Might just do that. Incidentally, this entire review was hand written, so as I said, the product could be really useful.",3
"I am writing this review after 4 months of using the tab. The screen keeps flickering all the time, the tab restarts anytime of the day automatically, there are major software issues like can't attached anything on email, in short the tab will crash anytime for no reason. Waste of money, don't buy",1
This tab is not more faster than ipad 7th gen but if it comes to price then Samsung is way better than ipad because if we go with ipad 32 gb storage which is not expandable so after time there would be problem of storage but in samsung we are getting 64 gb with expansion. Now if we go for ipad 128 gb variant then it would be around 38k and with pen Worth 8k then total price would be about 45k while s6 is with spen just for 28k. Now optimization is excellent in ipads but in s6 also it is very good. I am using this tab for 15 days and i found no issues. I used spen a lot infact i using it daily for 2-3 hrs and still working fine. I got two times update of 400 mb and 700 mb just under the usage of 10 days. I tried critical ops game of 500 mb where i am getting constantly 60-61 fps and no lag issue. So for everything this tab is perfect. So from my side a thumbs up for this tab.,5
"My experience of using this tablet upto the second day:
*battery charging too slow, it took 2.30hrs to charge 50% on the second day itself.(point: 2/5)
*Battery draining- slow but not too slow ( point 4/5)
*Stylus writing- too smooth (point: 5/5)
*Overall writing experience (point : 5/5)
* Heating effect- not any
* Hand touchability - lags a little bit (point 4/5)
* Tablet hangs a little on the first day itself (point 2/5)
*Overall experience (point: 3/5)",3
"Just awesome. I own an IPad, it's really awkward that I'm saying that it challenges it in every aspect other than only one thing, that is screen quality. But at this price you can't expect too much. The addition of s-pen just adds to the fun. I also own a samsung Note 8 and the best part is NOTE 8 s-pen also works with this... No need of the finger print sensor, face recognition works as a charm. Only in bright light the screen has a lot of reflection and video watching is a problem but that we can handle since it's not an AMOLED screen. Wish they had increased the price a little and added AMOLED. Rest everything is inexplicably awesome. If your budget is less this is the tablet for you. Just go for it without a second thought, you can't get any tab better than this at this price range. SUPERB!!!",5
Dont go for any other product in this price segment . I would keep it even above an ipad 7th gen becuause of the storage and s pen which is included in the box. Display not amoled but 90 percent times it wont matter. Especially the apps provided with samusung pays for all the price. The s pen is worth every penny. No problems about camera. Watching netflix youtube prime videos taking notes and surfing through internet were my main purpose n it serves it all. Excellent product in the price. I love it . Easily recommend. Superb build quality n presence of earphone jack . Superb battery it lasted me around 10 hrs of screen every single day . Charger provided is slow but u can use any other phone charger which is around 15 watt or 18 watt n it would charge quickly. Dont hesitate to buy,5
"Folks, in short, this is the best tab available in this range. I don't want to give opinion about investing 5k or 10k more for an iPad. I mean if you think like that then you can go upto ipad pro.

If you budget is 25k, and you want a great tablet, just go for it. Good screen, great sound, very sleek and screen to body ratio is damn good. Plus you get a decent pen which you really need to use tablets. If you are a designer or wanna use it for high level animation, better fo for Apple as per 1000s of reviews on YouTube. For a normal guy who likes to browse, watch videos on youtube, prime, Netflix and scroll through insta, Facebook or twitter, this is just perfect. Don't invest one more penny.

Pre booking offer: Have patience. Mine got activated in less than 40 hours. Keep trying once or twice a day. Try restarting device once after the activation of device for sooner results.",5
"Buy Android tablets only if on a tight budget. Go for iPad if your budget is around 50 to 60k. For students on a tight budget : it's a perfect gadget. Only issue : a little smaller size (10.4"" will definitely seem small as the copies we use are generally 12"" or more).

Remember : The only thing that will maoe a tablet feel perfect is the software (I mean the software you use for notetaking like OneNote). And trust me : no app supports android system as great as they do in iPad OS. Yeah that's a harsh reality. And you have to admit it.

Btw, over time, samsung has improved a lot in its apps like Samsung notes and other stuff but still not comparable to what OneNote gives (to iPad users)

"Highly satisfied with this tab s6 lite
I'm Android lover and irritate to use multiple accessories. Look
I'm analysing on priority order.
1. No or minimum screen gap (so I preferred it over normal ipad) ( I didn't prefer any Screengaurd because I mainly used it for note taking)
2. As I use Android phone so same charger and asserosries are required. No issue to carry multiple charger one for tab and other for mobile.
3. Sound is loud and surround. (Best for movie and gaming)
4. SPen- you get with the box. (Point of pen is replaceable so no issue) it's smooth and fast.

One thing is missing in it that it doesn't have any stock desktop mode as of now. (Tab s6 has)

If you did not believe in showing off (üçé) then just go for it.",5
"So I ordered this right after Samsung announced Tab S7.
Because what would make someone spend so much for a tablet.

Got this WiFi only tab for ‚Çπ25800, thanks to Prime day offers.

Pros:

1) Very nice design with metal and glass.
2) Great display with apt resolution. Not AOLED and don't compare with costly tablets. It's not over saturated unlike most of samsung displays.
3) Stereo sound. Well placed stereo speakers providing great output. I love watching movies in this tablet.
4) A free S Pen. Seriously ryt?! My wife draws and she is loving this. There are lot of free drawing softwares.
5) Battery life. Never expected such good battery life from Samsung tbh. But this stands out. Watched movies continuously and had 50% left.
6) This will be too good for students and researchers. Easy to take notes. It reads your hand writing smoothly. Even mine which is so bad :D

Cons:

1) Dex. May be too much to expect for this price. But yeah, would have been nice if it had Dex.
2) Don't see performance issue for now, but might cause problem if on boarded with lot of apps.

Go for it if your uses are to take notes, watch Netflix, etc. It's worth every penny.",4
"if you are a professional digital artist or more into digital art and video editing, blindly go for iPad pro..
everything is perfect with s6 lite...but kind of worried about S PEN ,built quality of s pen is not that good..more precisely the NIB or tip of the pen...it must be replaced for every month...but couldn't find any supportive tips or NIB from Samsung right now...",5
I bought this tab only for the spen and I was totally disapointed. I waited 9days jus for the delivery and now its out of stock so opted for the refund. The spen feels totally absurd i thght it wld have better quality and feel as evry review on youtube was comparing it to the apple pencil. Drawing on this tablet though is really good and the screen okay but they wash out a bit when viewd from the sides. Only go for this tablet if its and upgrade other wise your gonna not like it. On the other hand build quality is solid very premium and even its a treat to watch vedios on this. All in all i would have kept it only if the spen was not sabotaged i dont wevn know how the packaging was good and sealed. Guess the spen is really not up to build quality. Sadly enough il be going for the new ipad now which will by grace of apple launch by next mth hopefully. Samsung lost a customer jus so for the pen. I really hoped to spend money on an 8grand appel pen than jus a free pen because it really shows the quality you get when you pay for it.,4
"The tab s6 is okay and is powerful enough for most daily work but at a similar price, I think an IPad is much much better. Ipad is optimised for the pencil which is simply too good. Android, windows and chrome apps are not optimised for handwriting. Ipads are much more powerful and the pencil experience is simply superb. Apple is much much more intuitive, palm rejection is superb, you can write in any input box and not limited to the small writing pad that android or windows offer. Samsung keyboard is the worst keyboard for handwriting, but gboard somehow gets the work done. Overall a decent entry level tablet which is actually nothing more than a bigger android phone. Buy and entry level ipad. It will be hundred times more satisfying if you want a good tablet experience.",3
"Tab is superb.
Pros:
Build quality is all metal and you feel the premium design who you pick it up(5/5)
Super bright and sharp screen but is not ambled but superb.(5/5)
Sound is Dolby atoms in built .Two speakers feel like you are out of world (5/5)
Camera is amazing seeing that it is a tablet.(4/5)
S pen is ossum and premium, There is no tip problem ,the tip is made as it is ,it is a rubberized tip and not defective.(5/5)
Up and OS (5/5)
**Most Important , Pre book offer:- Got galaxy buds plus @2999 which is a super amazing deal at this price and buds plus are one of a kind(5/5).

Cons:
At this price point and pre book offer there is no cons about it as the price is reduced to rs 19,000 for one who purchased before 18 June 2020 and redeemed galaxy buds plus for just rs 2,999 whose original cost is rs.12,000
Overall- (10/10)
And thus price becomes rs 28,000 - rs.9,000 =rs. 19,000
Rs 9000( extra discounted price of galaxy buds plus due to pre book offer coupon).

"I'm writing the review after 2 months of continuous use. I bought the tab for studying purpose only.
Battery
1. You have to charge it for almost 2.5 hrs to charge from 15% to 100%
2. It takes 3 hrs or more than that to charge from below 5% to 95%
3. Full charge last for 8 to 9 hours which is good.
4. If used for only reading it last for around 10 hrs which is too good.
Display
1. Too good. No issues.
Sound
1. Has dolby.. Its a kiier to watch movies and series.. Really impressed.
S pen
This is what everyone is confused of.. So I'll give it in more detail.
1. The pen is fragile. Very fragile that it looks like it may stop working anytime.
2. You really have to handle like a feather. No rough useage. Be really soft if you wanna use it for a long time
3. I dropped it once from around 2 ft high accidentally. I was scared.. But it works really fine.
4. Can't use for long hours of note taking (according to me). It ia suitable for short notes, highlighting pdfs editing etc. Has inbuilt apps for everything.

Bottom line- go for it if you wanna use it for studying.",4
"Brought this for online studies for my kids. After a couple of months usage the one fine day we see the wifi service is not starting, took to the Samsung serive center only to be informed that it's a hardware issue due to which wifi , bluetooth etc are not starting and needs a replacement. Unfortunately the hardware is not available and I need to wait, waiting now since more than a week. Would nit recommend this , rather if you are ok go for a minimal configuration laptop.",1
"Product is good, however i missed the option to check the SIM card slot, if you are paying 30K then the customer must get a simple SIM card slot, did not check this in the product details, a dissapointment as compared to the ipad of same range, samsung please take a note of it, even lenovo at 20K range is providing better specs.",4
"I have been using this since 1day. These are some things I found. I'll update my review if I find something new.
First let's talk about display, It's a TFT LCD display, we don't get a screen like amoled but it's surprisingly good.
Performance: upto now it's handling good, I did not play any large game, but small games and multitasking works well. It's obvious if you are going to buy a tablet in this budget for gaming definitely go for ipad because it has a much better chip.
Battery: I did not use much but the battery is holding good really although the charge speed is low.
Spen: I used it for writing something, it actually worked well but it is sensitive, don't use it rough.
Speakers are really good, you will enjoy the sound believe me.
Build quality and look are really good, the weight is somewhere near 470 grams. It is heavy but evenly distributed, so you won't feel too heavy.
Please don't expect a camera review because it's not meant for that, even high level tabs won't give a good camera experience. I can say it's good for document scanning and video calls.
Overall I really liked this tab, In this budget it's a beast. Saying again it's not for heavy gamers. It's a very good tablet for studying, multitasking, drawing and a little gaming.
Thank you, hope this helps.",5
"Competition always improves the experience for the consumer. And this cannot be more true regarding Samsung. Slew of Chinese low costers in last few years seems to have prepped Samsung to improve its product lineup and this tablet is a good example of this. Seamless operation, minimal lag and no heat up issues. Build and form are neat and user friendly. Exynos chip does the job and for the price it is definitely value for money. The S-pen is also good but for me it's more of a good to have than just have. Some users may find it very useful. There was a constant complaint that Samsung provided less than competition for the same price, however after using this for a month I think that is no longer true.",5
"It's totally amazing
I am a medical student and bought it for streaming some videos , taking notes and annotationing PDFs it perfectly does all of that .
A big point for the chiffon pink colour as it's so sleek and the colour is really unique I loved it.
I read people complaining about display but it's not at all lacking or seems any less even brightness is good .
Spen also works really well.
Battery takes about 2-3 hours to fully charge but easily last at least 2 days with High multimedia use .so it's not a big concern .
Overall a really good tablet and a better choice than ipad considering that spen comes free and has alot more features and storage .",5
" This tab is the replacement for my I pad 6th gen as per my point of view because it's not that much costly and at this price so much of features... Samsung deserves and bow down üëèüëè

"I bought this as a gift for my mother. And oh boy, she is so fond of it. Its very easy for her to control the tablet. Most of the time this is used for media consumption and entertainment, so display is a perfect 5/5 for me. It won't give you excellence an OLED or AmoLED panel, but this definitely is not a bad display. You will enjoy this.

I find the audio to be on the above average in terms of loudness, but it is decent in terms of quality.

I bought this as a pre-order, so I was able to get Samsung's Galaxy Buds+ as well for just 3K (a steal deal).

You can definitely go for this, if your sole purpose is media consumption plus some casual indie gaming.",5
Can see shadow of any app after using for 10 mins..... and this is just after 7 days .... very bad experience,1
"Tip appeared frayed even before using. Can manage to write for now, but not sure how long it will last. No extra tips provided. Bought the tab only for s pen. Pathetic customer service from Samsung. They did not even provide any information regarding replacement tips. Disappointed. Many people seem to be having a similar problem. Poor quality control. Amazon says I can replace s pen along with tablet only.
Performance is okay with slight lag occasionally I just use it for reading pdf and browsing. Screen bleeds along the corners.
The only reason I did not ask
for replacement was there was no stock here or elsewhere and I need it for online classes.",2
"4 days use review
Pros:
Stylus
Battery life

Camera is average not a good not bad for a tab.

Cons
Very thing
Charging is slow takes too long for complete charge
Hangs a lot
4 days in use screen got pixels issue(luckily I had a near by service center unluckily its a new model will take 15days to get it replaced)",2

It's definitely value for money product and it's very slim also... metallic body finish is very attractive...screen brightness is pretty good but it can be better if it would be Super Amoled screen (which is Samsung uniqueness), may be this is the only one negative point of this tablet... otherwise product is very nice...S-pen is also working fine...
Overall I am very much satisfied with this device...",5
"Samsung has improved in tablets suddenly this year, their Tab s6 Lite is a good tablet, to begin with, artworks. The usability of the pencil felt good and quite fast to draw. The standard apps are bit messy so bought ArtRage which worked quite nicely with this tablet.

Design & Build: This tablet is good in design aesthetics and materials almost as good as Ipad, what it lacks is the screen quality, colours control are well taken care of, but one negative is this TFT display panel shows colour hinges in corners it was the same for the Tab 10.1 which I reviewed here https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R3V6OH25HJRK17?ref=pf_ov_at_pdctrvw_srp

Made is solid and the tablet is lighter than Tab10.1, Processor is fast and speedy, so tablet felt responsive in most games, even in the MMORPG that I played.",4
"Received this product on 3rd October 2020 and I found that the bill is missing with the serial no. of the product. I immediately raised the concern with the team but didn't received any solution till now.
The problem here is not with Amazon but with its seller i.e., ""Appario Retail Ltd."" as I found on internet that same incident has happened with other buyers also purchasing from same seller.

The tab works fine though. It is excellent for students and for note taking and the S Pen is fabulous. The design definitely gives a premium feel but you will find some lag while using it which you will get used to. Battery takes all the pride as it is mind boggling.

Good product but seriously very poor service from this seller and Amazon. Don't hesitate to spend few extra bucks and buy it from different seller on amazon.

PS: This product is fulfilled by Amazon Guarantee.

Update: Received the rectified reciept with serial number after 24 days of follow up.

Thanks.",1
The tab seems fine but the s pen is not. The s pen I got writes even when nib does not touch the surface. Its so irritating and makes it useless for taking notes or drawing. I went for S6 Lite only because s pen came with it. I am seriously thinking of returning my S6 Lite and buying IPad 10.2 instead. Yes I may have to pay little more but I atleast can be assured of quality.,2
"I got the tab and I loved it, but the right speaker was defective on my device, the sound was popping and crackling at full volume (somewhat like when you are trying to tune a radio).

Got the replacement which has the same issue, I didn't expect this from Samsung tbh.

Everything else is good, build quality, the spen.

If you are buying please test everything out. I don't trust it anymore.",2
"Initial impression on the tablet is good, bit heavy to my liking. But we will get used to it I guess. Will post more once I start using the tablet.

Pre Order offer is not working in Samsung Shop app, it says ""Serial number not eligible"". Both Amazon and Samsung is clueless about offer and not much of a help at this point. Really disappointed with how they handle customer.",3
"This is one of the best purchases I have made. The tablet seamlessly handles multiple apps running at once especially its windows like pop up windows which can be minimized. The tablet has been able to handle all games I have wanted to play on it including flight simulator X and PSP emulation.

The stylus which is included with the tablet makes it the best value proposition when compared to the iPad along. The tablet is basically a mini laptop with the appropriate stand and keyboard and am able to do 90% of the things I usually did on my laptop including lightweight spreadsheets.",5
"The tab S6 Lite is a real great device for working on. Unfortunately the only drawback is the S PEN which is the main attraction for purchasing the device, the tablet arrived with a frayed Spen not once but twice in a row, the replacement product also had a defective S PEN.
Really disappointed in Amazon's response was so casual to this incident, since this the first time it's happening to me on Amazon.
The tablet on the other hand is very good for the price, the sound quality is excellent with samsung's AKG speakers.
The display is very crisp and sharp despite the TFT display.
It runs very smoothly even on gaming. One full charge lasts for minimum 4 days.
The picture quality is pretty good considering its not an Amoled screen.
It's a really good device for media streaming and taking notes.
Though it's a lite version it's loaded with pretty good features for example you can sync your Sam mobile to the tab and receive calls and msgs from your mobile to the Tab.

The drawing capabilities of the tablet is also pretty good considering the configuration of the product

The tablet is not completely a professional tablet but yes u can send and receive emails via outlook and use MS OFFICE upto a certain extent as in u can edit and send files but it lags quite lot while creating a new excel sheet or a PDF file.

The bluetooth keyboard that is available in the market from different brands comes in handy for typing for eg writing email etc.
If u are searching for a lag free and efficient tablet and looking to replacing ur laptop with a tablet then don't go for this tablet go for the next generation tab S7 but if you are looking to use this as a secondary device then go for it.

In comparison to other brands this is definitely a very good budget device since it includes the S PEN at no extra cost especially for students

If it hadn't been the frayed SPEN this tablet is worth every penny.",2
"VERY IMPORTANT: please make sure you check the number to which your IMEI number is linked after purchasing any mobile or tablet product. I got this product delivered on 21st June 2021, and when I checked, this product was already activated on 15th June 2021. This meant either my product was opened before it reached me or it is a refurbished/used product.
My purchase was made from Kolkata, whereas the number that is linked to my IMEI is from Karnataka. Funny stuff.
Samsung will NOT help you in getting that link changed. BE AWARE! not everything that comes from Amazon is clean.

The product is perfect, but if someone is concerned about security, please make sure you check this immediately after purchase because many and most of us don't look into these nitty-gritties. A different number linked to the IMEI of a product owner by you is a serious security concern, apart from the fact that you will not be eligible for any of the Samsung offers and memberships.

"I don't like writing reviews but had to write this one since I had to dig a lot about this product to figure out its capabilities in my use case. Might help out someone.

I needed a portable device for four things, drawing, 3d sculpting, testing Google ARcore, and an external monitor for my pc.
Which means I wanted a decent af pen with good response and pressure support.
It was easy to find art reviews for this tablet for drawing, but for 3d sculpting, I couldn't find a single one.
So I was pretty much winging it when I ordered it.

Tho it did deliver what I required. The device can easily handle 3-4mil polys on Nomad sculpt which is basically sculptris for Android. That means I won't have to be stuck to my pc to use Zbrush for the minor things. I'm easily able to make base meshes on the go. I ran multiple stress tests on Nomad and the max scene poly was at 6mil. After that, it's pretty much unusable. so if u r looking to sculpt on this device, that's your cap.

Now the pen. It's AWESOME. It's a bummer that they didn't provide any replacement nibs but I still got S6 nibs online which work just fine with S6 lite's spen. I've heard that Samsung licensed Wacom tech for their spen which explains this quality. I've used 1st gen apple pencil but charging them was a hassle. And it had a thicker pen tip, blocking a little bit of the screen. but the spen doesn't have those issues. Amazingly the spen feels just as responsive as my huion tablet/pen. There's a little bit of latency but not noticeable when working. The only concern is replacement pens since I couldn't find the official s6 lite pen anywhere on the internet(which could be delivered at my location). Some people on Reddit had similar problems. IK other spen are supported but this ones a battery-free pen which is god sent.

Then there's ARcore support which is nice, though there are no depth-sensing(single cam), which makes sense, I would be asking for too much at this point.

And the battery backup is decent, I get a good 3-5 hours of work time, but charging a bit slow at 2-3 hours. Its 7k mah so its probably justified, tho a high watt charger (or charger support) would've been better.

I could've gone for an IPad pro (and really wanted surface go 2), but thanks to insane Indian import charges it completely unaffordable. Nonetheless this tablet works for me.",5
"It's all about S pen , don't keep any high expectations. But it works for the amount you pay.
Main uses are
1. YouTube
2. Movies
3. Video calls
*Battery life is 10% for 1 hr of usage.
* Don't over stress the S pen tip , it looks like it is going to Frey. But writing experience is good.",4
"I was a bit skeptical regarding buying a tablet from an online shop as I have heard some horror stories about it. But I loved the amazon delivery. Safe to say that In the future I can buy things more than 10k from here.
Coming to the tab I bought it for just studying purpose. I make tremendous amount of notes and I wanted a cheap tab with a stylus so I guess this is the best option, also it's my first time using a stylus pen and so far iam in love with the functions of Samsung notes and the pen.
Only one downside that I didn't know was Samsung will not be releasing the official keyboard I guess I'll have to buy a Bluetooth keyboard to work with. Would have given 5 stars for the keyboard",4
Tab is good deal but Samsung pre booking order is not available which is very disappointing.,1
"Pros:
1. Large scren
2. tested watching video and drawing for approx. 2 hours - battery was still half remaining
3. Smooth UI - No lag
4. Great sound quality
Cons:
1. Charging would have been faster
2. No Dual camera
3. Do not support USB C dock for HDMI/USB devices [as supported in note 9, Dex Mode]
4. No earphone in the package.",4
"Display failed in 9 months. Customer service doesn't honor ""in-warranty"" repairs. They have ""no-stock"" of the display.

Finally, I figured out that the issue is not related to display, but poor workmanship. The display ribbon had come off from the Motherboard and due to this the display was not turning on. However, instead of fixing my issue, the customer service rep argued that they have best engineers and how they know for ""SURE"" that it is a display issue. After arguing with them for 30mins, the engineer graciously agreed to look into my issue.

Worst part of the whole ordeal is that the customer reps don't even open your product. Just by looking at it (and probably some Tarot cards), they divine the issue and send you off because they don't have ""stock"".",1
"I was searching for a good tablet with good battery life and this one fullfilled all my expectations. A good size tablet not that heavy to hold ,as per gaming the tablet's performance is ok but it's not meant for harcore gaming. Last but not the least the stylus which Samsung offering with the tablet is it's USP never used any stylus mobiles before but after using it it really takes the tablet to a different level the use of it is immense be it swiping drawing taking notes it's make slide easy for the user. Over all a good tablet with good price range",5
" Restart Loop Issue:
- Samsung tablets even the older models seems to be plagued with this issue where it gets stuck at the ""Samsung"" logo screen, I started experiencing this just after 2 weeks of getting the tablet, initially wiping the cache partition and force restarting the tablet couple of times would bring the home screen but in the last 2 months this solution wouldn't work either. I have mentioned below the steps to get to the home screen if it gets stuck.

Solution A:
- Press and Hold ""Power"" and ""Volume Down"" button for few seconds, this will restart the tablet, immediately press and hold ""Power"" and ""Volume Up"" button for few seconds this will bring the ""Android System Recovery"" screen, here do ""Wipe Cache Partition"" and after that select ""Reboot System Now"" option. If this doesn't work in the first try, give it couple of more tries and then move to next solution.

Solution B:
- If the previous solution doesn't work then the only option is to drain the battery completely, so let the tablet be stuck at the restart loop, if the battery is charged over 80% then it will take more than 6 hours for the battery to drain. Once the tablet shuts down, charge it to 100% then press the ""Power"" button, the tablet might show you the ""Android System Recovery"" screen, here select ""Reboot System Now"" option and the tablet should restart and boot to the home screen. This is the only solution that works consistently every time and I had to do this about 5 times till now.

Preventing Restart Loop Issue:
- Setting the ""Power Mode"" to ""Medium power saving"" seems to fix this issue, I faced the restart issue 3 weeks back and after following solution b and getting to the home screen I set this option and the tablet hasn't restarted even once. I didn't notice any performance dip with this setting but obviously will effect gaming performance. To activate it go to ""Settings > Device Care > Battery > Power Mode > Medium Power Saving"". In the ""Battery"" menu there is a ""Charging > Protect Battery"" option where you can set the tablet to charge up to ""85%"" to prolong the battery life, when I got the tablet, I had immediately enabled this option, so I am not sure if this triggered the restart issue but I have tried disabling it (without enabling Medium Power Saving) and still the restart issue kept happening. Right now I have only enabled the ""Medium Power Saving"" mode and disabled the ""Protect Battery"" option.

Cause:
- Defective battery seems to cause this restart issue, so replacing it, as per forums and YouTube videos seems to fix this issue.

Customer Support:
- I contacted customer support and got the typical reply to bring the table to service center. This is my first Samsung tablet and I figured out how to fix the issue myself, disappointed that the customer support didn't provide this solution in the first place as this is a known issue.

Pros:
- The stylus is great and really a must have in tablets, I had a iPad Mini 2 before and it's a pain to navigate tablets without stylus. Doesn't need any charging. Shows a cursor when the stylus is near the screen, this is really useful when drawing and in websites the cursor acts like regular mouse cursor. The stylus is smooth on screen, comfortable to use and also durable, haven't faced any problems in 5 months of use. The software too is optimized for stylus, you can write on the screen without unlocking the phone or pressing the power button, has excellent handwriting recognition which you can use in any browser too.
- The dual speakers are loud and sound great and does have nice sound stage, gives decent surround experience and doesn't distort at higher volumes. Doly Atmos can be enabled when using the speakers as well as when using headphones. It's with headphones that you get the best of Dolby Atmos, I use ""Arctis 5"" headphone and the tablet delivers rich ambient sounds and clear audio and it's a real pleasure watching movies and listening to music in this tablet.
- Display is not Amoled but still good, accurate colors, good resolution, etc.

Cons:
- Defective hardware and terrible customer support.
- In my Samsung A5 2017 mobile, when updating Samsung apps via the Galaxy Store, Samsung would install third party apps without asking any permission. When I noticed this, I removed all those unnecessary apps and stopped updating Galaxy Apps but despite this after a month I noticed those apps installed again, I had to go to the app settings of Galaxy Store and deny all permissions to stop this from happening. This only happened in the A5 and doesn't happen in Tab S6 but I am not sure if Samsung will start doing this on the Tab S6 in future too. This is a breach of privacy and am disappointed that Samsung is resorting to this to make money.

Final Thoughs:
If your priority is media consumption, drawing, etc. then I would strongly recommend Samsung Tab S6 Lite. Apple's iPads at this price range are pathetic. If you are looking for an ecosystem to get into for long term then I would strongly recommend Apple iPads, having used iPad Mini 2, I can assure you the software experience is the best. the iPad also worked for more than 3 years without any issues and got the latest operating system updates every year, so unlike Android you are not limited to just 2 years max of operating system updates.

PS: If you are going to buy memory card, only buy ""Sandisk Extreme"" cards, I bought a pair of 128 GB memory cards of ""Samsung Evo"" and ""HP"" and all 4 of these cards ended up being defective.",2
"I just want to know why, when i turn on my new tablet for the first time, tanlet's name was written as Paikhomba' galaxy tab s6 lite. these people is sending me a already used tablet as a new one... shame on you. and the spen that xame with it is already scratched.

and the screen was not covered with plastic film, which proves that they repacked already used tablet.",1
"It looks good and slim but one has to put cover to protect it from accidental fall in any case.

Performance is good so far.

The s pen tip seems to be frail and frayed a bit which is alarming for a new piece but it work okay. Samsung should at least offer the sale of nib if they are not gonna bundle extra nibs.

The redemption offer worked after 3 days of registering at samsung shop.

It is good for students and guys on a budget for taking notes or drawing.

Though for those who can afford to spend more, it is better to get the iPad with apple pencil.",5
"Black spot observed after a months usage in left lower corner of tab. Approached samsung customer care and local service centre. Samsung local service centre response was horrible. Have to send to a service centre 200 kms away and they verified it as a manufacturing defect. Replacement of screen is under process.
Experienced for first time a screen problem in samsung product. Donot go for it
Pros
1. S pen
2. Sleek design
3. Light weight and easy to handle
4. Good battery
Cons
1. Screen is substandard
2. Laid back processor
3. Lagging software
SCREEN BURN OBSERVED AFTER USAGE OF ONE MONTH. HAVE TO APPROACH SAMSUNG SERVICE CENTRE. THEY ASKED FOR SCREEN REPLACEMENT UNDER WARRANTY. VERY DISAPPOINTED AS I NEVER EXPERIENCED SCREEN PROBLEM FROM SAMSUNG PRODUCT TILL DATE.",1
"One of the best products of samsung. I'm pretty sure they're going to increase the price of this tablet.
Samsung's S-pen is the best in the market, so challenge there.
I doubt if there's anything that i should complain about.
Best in it's price range.
People say that it doesn't have an Amoled screen but they need to understand that the battery life would decrease or the price would increase. So that's not a valid point at all.

Palm rejection, memory of 64GB, RAM, screen size, AUDIO QUALITY, user interface.
Everything is great.

If you can afford this then don't even think and yes it's better than I-Pad mini pro.",4
"I received a faulty product.
The tablet got really hot just after turning on even if no apps were running. And I don't mean warm, very hot and uncomfortable to even touch. Was worried it might blow up like the note 7 series.
Returned it.",1
"Just Awesome in this price range. Most of the Andoid tablet makers are not serious in this segment except Samsung, and yet again they proved they are the masters of device making on Amdroid platform. This is the best Android tablet in this price range.
Pro: Screen quality (Dont compare it with Super Amoled in this price range) is awesome despite TFT, they have really used high quality TFT panel.
Sound: Tuned by AKG and dual streo speakers produces perfect sound that you require from a tablet.
Battery: Backup is awesome, have charged upto only 40% and have already spent more than 4 hours of screen time.
Stylus : SPen gives you an extra advantage of managing various things uisng air commands (though its not BT enabled like in S7+, but does a lot of things for you easily).

Cons:. No finger print sensor, though you have face recognition which works pretty fine.
Camera: Camera position should have been horizontal for better exp on calls and screen unlock.

By far I am satisfied with this tablet in this price range.",5
"Damaged packaging.
The device heats up a lot near the base at the left and right edges.
The s-pens nib looks used.",3
"I am writing this after 8 months of usage
the tablet was good but the s pen worn out quickly and they don't include any spare nibs
without the styles spending 30k for this is worthless
And while contacting the samsung service center they said that I need to buy a new s pen which cost around 2k
Initially I was planning to buy üçé but due their enormous pricing and service charge I had to go for Samsung
But then I realized all the companies are same
I strongly recommend buyers to consider this before planning to buy this tablet.
And I hope samsung will provide spare nibs in the future",1
"I received this item when I was in quarantine and I couldn't able to go through it. Once after my quarantine is over my return period also got over. The first day I tried with SPen, it was malfunctioning. Hope Amazon will understand my situation and replace the item.

Other than that, the tablet is really awesome!",3
"This product is awesome, very good on the eyes for reading, zoom in and zoom out for reading online books, newspaper is a breeze.
Watching OTT platforms is very convenient, eye adjusts to the screen size without any strain even after over 2 hours of viewing
If you not too hung up on face recognition screen unlock feature , just go for it .
The S pen is an added accessory, I don‚Äôt use it very often though.
Not a gamer so cannot comment on gaming performance.
One star less due to the screen unlock face recognition issue.
Make sure to get a good cover jacket, else the device tends to slip off the hands.
Hope my experience will be helpful for prospective buyers.",4
"It's a good tablet and it works really well with the SPen. While browsing or scrolling vertically in any apps the view is not that much pleasant maybe if its the snapdragon processor this would be reduced more. I bought this Tab only for taking notes and UI/UX Design and it serves the purpose. This is my first tab with SPen and I am very much impressed with its performance when using SPen. I bought this product under 26k with offers and discounts. If you are having AMOLED Display smartphones you will feel lots of difference in screens but still with 1080p TFT display it looks really good with its own features. For this price range, they could have afforded AMOLED Display but still, I am okay with the display. 10.4 inch looks stunning when you guys are watching videos and speakers also good.

This tab is not for intense gaming so forget about the gaming fun here. You can play games in low-level settings and some medium level games for entertainment. I am not a fan of gaming but still I tested and gave my feedback.

Design - 10/10 (2020 Model Design)
Battery - 8/10
Charging - 7/10
Display - 7/10
SPen - 10/10 (Because it's my first tablet with SPen)
Speakers - 8/10",4
"One of the best tablet in the price segment. Size is adequate for reading and watching movies.
It will be sufficient for most of the day today works like surfing, reading and basic image editing tasks.
One major con is that it won't support free microsoft office as the screen size is bigger than 10 inch.You will have to purchase it for additional cost. Event hough you can use free tools like WPS office and Google sheets as replacement.
But if you are particular about Microsoft office, be ready to shed some extra money for that.
Another issue is with the charger capacity. 5V with 1.55A will take almost 4 hours for charging. Not sure if it can support Samsung fast charger, which I didn't try as it can damage battery if not supported.
Most of the games run smoothly, but cannot use this tablet for intense gaming,which may hit performance.

Go for this tablet if you are looking for a device which can satisfy all your basic requirements like reading,surfing,learning and basic gaming.",5
"Spen is useful, not just a sale gimmick.
Processor is a bit slow but for videos streaming, using teaching apps, Netflix, reading books and other general activities its easily manageable. PUBG can be played is higher resolution without lag but not with extreme settings. Battery lasts easily for a day. Camera I never use except for scanning documents and notes which is fine.",5
Tab is Ok. But SPen nib is damaged. Have video proof too that it was damaged right out of the box. Otherwise good tab. Very disappointed with Samsung for manufacturing faulty product. Or may be this was a replacement tab by someone else. So 4star,4
"Samsung has done a brilliant job with this tablet, competing neck to neck with iPad 7th gen. The device doesn‚Äôt lag anywhere and runs smoothly, touch is pretty responsive and flawless at par with an iPad, camera could‚Äôve been better but you don‚Äôt buy a tablet for photography the most you use it for video calling and it ticks that area.
Battery backup is pretty good, running video on ott platforms with location on for about 5 hours ate about 19% of the battery. So charge once completely and you‚Äôre set for next 24 hours with ease.
Coming to screen, quite impressive in this price segment, but iPad fares better than this, again not a complaint just a comparison.
Not a gamer, but ran couple of heavy games and it ran smoothly.
The sound quality is amazing, thanks to AKG and dolby atmos is a big boost. Pretty loud and crisp.
One thing that stands out most to me is the look and feel of the tablet, the back panel is metal finish and gives a premium feel.
S-pen is a bonus, works great, just be careful in handling it as it‚Äôs prone to getting damaged quickly if handled carelessly.
So overall this is a pretty decent device in this price without any problems, go for it you won‚Äôt be disappointed.",5
"Over all tablet is good for students who want to take notes and spend time on reading ...
4 stars for tablet
1 star for providing me with broken s pen nip , and the nib was of very cheap quality seems like someone have already used it. The original s pen nib has silicon tip but the one Amazon which was delivered to me was made of plastic quality. ( hope amazon/samsung resolve this issue asap) I have added photo comparing both blue one bought it from offline store for my sister whereas the black colour s pen is the which was delivered to me today with broken nib.
Totally disappointed üòûüòí...",4
"Great budget tab for medical students and other students looking to take notes and attend online classes. The tablet has many great features which are explained in youtube videos. Apps like onenote, incredible pro, etc can be used for note taking. Would give 10/10 to this tablet. Highly recommended! Great battery life, I took notes continuously for 6 -7 hrs during my zoom classes and battery was still 50 percent. Light weight tab, good stylus, perfect size. Would recommend buying a cover and keyboard for optimal use.",5
"The seller could offer the option to replace to choose from the varied Colors of the product. Amazon and the sellers onboard should also include the ""want different color type"" as a condition for qualifying to replace the product with that of different color.
I did compromise with the color of the product, I didn't like for this rigid return policy of the Amazon.",3
"I have received the tablet and its just amazing. Everything is perfect. Call quality is also good. But as per instructions, i am still uable to redeem the prebook offer. Can ayobe help me with Prebook offer?",5
"The screen resolution is not great. The UI is laggy. I just use it for content streaming with ample of storage space vacant but still the experience is not as smooth as one expects. The tablet has received a couple of updates since the purchase but none have provided a lag free experience.
The speakers are great and so is the wireless connectivity. I received a pen with damaged tip. But it works and I am not a pen user so it didnt matter much. Your mileage may vary depending upon your use case.
TBH iPad 2020 though 10-12k more expensive would provide a far better experience. How can a device with no games and only 30-40 % storage used with 4 gigs of Ram lag in normal browsing within the UI is beyond me.",4
"The Tab is ok. Screen/colour bleeding on edges is a a real bummer. But main issue I have is with the way the tab was packed and deliveried by Amazon. The outer package was heavily damaged and there was no protective covering for the tablet box inside, as a result of which the tab box inside was also damaged. Zero stars for Amazon.",3
I have been using this tab from last 10 days. I am impressed with its built quality and performance. Bought it for editing my youtube videos and its performance is superb. For more review you can visit my youtube channel LUCKNAWI NAWAB as also displayed in the image above. Subscribe for more information.,5
"Very nice built QUALITY, feels GOOD in HAND, battery back is OKAY, GOOD performance and UI, but I'm NOT satisfied with the spen. spen feels good in the hand but tip is SMALL and we can't put pressure on it, feels like it might break or get damaged. At least could have given a bigger tip or extra tip in the box.",4
"Work from home life has become so much simpler with this tab. You can join meetings and calls from anywhere with this tab. No need to sit infront of your laptop. You can easily move around the house during meetings. Screen size is good so say goodbye to straining your eyes if you are joining meetings from mobile. The S pen does makes your life simpler while typing emails or chatting in Teams or whatsapp, no need to connect additional keyboard for faster typing. Good sound quality. Its a pleasure to binge watch your favourite movies/series from this device. Overall very satisfied with this product.",5
Tab is good. But I have not yet received the galaxy buds plus offer in samsung Shop. Has anyone got claimed pre booked offer?,5
"I read all the reviews and really I had doubt, specially about the S-pen. I read about frayed tips etc.
But may I say, it is awesomeeeeee.....
The purpose for me is note taking.. and really it's great I bought it!!!!!!!
The tab has a perfect look...
The packaging was okay..
And god S-pen just became my fav now....
It's really good.. Go for it....",5
"Screen quality is perfect. Viewing angle is good. No dead pixels. Battery life is average, charging is slow from the provided adapter, OTG works fine, note taking apps are Nice, S pen is nice just replace the nib with a hard one and you'll be good to go

I was in confusion whether to take this or the ipad. Apple ecosystem is nice and premium but i am just a casual student i don't need those fancy items. S6 lite is more practical to me. Got it in 25.5 k (only wifi) . Happy with my purchase.",5
"Good product from Samsung. SPen looks very fragile, and don't see replacement Spens on any sites.

Terrible service by Amazon (although the reps are courteous). The No Cost EMI was charged to me despite me calling them and confirming multiple times. They don't have a clue how to solve the issue. Seems it's a back end issue, and the back end thinks ths front end people are stupid. Anyway, my first terrible experience with Amazon.",4
"I have a habit of sitting in armchair and reading by resting the book on my stomach. As I try to read a book using this tablet, the moment I rest it on my stomach, the screen gets switched off!! I tried to change settings, tried tweaking Smart Stay option given by this tablet, tried increasing screen timeout. But no luck!!! It is some high tech gesture support that just does not work properly. If you are active and using it, screen remains on. But the moment you relax and sit back, the screen goes off. And it seems there is no way to disable it. I am quite tech savvy.
For me, it is not at all usable for reading. Good for watching videos etc. Good sound quality.
But, due to this major flaw, I haven't got my money worth. Giving 1 star.",1
"+ 10"" screen is a good addition to gadgets at home.
+ Works well with the SPen. Great pen. Beats wacom tablets.

- Battery charging takes too much time.
- Speaker could have been louder.

Overall great. It's better than ipad in the same price range.",5
"I'm writing this after extensive use for two weeks.
Pros
1. Excellent Design and Body Frame. Pretty light to hold.
2. Sound is fantastic. Watch movies video calls you will not have any issues
3. S Pen with this tablet makes a difference. Write draw note etc. It works perfectly.
4. Performance is pretty good. I didn't face any lag during my usage. If you have phone with 90hz or 120hz display you might notice some smoothness issue. This is just due to your phone have higher refresh rate.
5. Gaming I played COD with high graphic and Asphalt 9, personally I didn't face any lag at all.
6. Expandable storage.
7. Battery is great. With moderate to heavy usage you will get 7-10 hours screen on time. Standby just amazing.

Cons
1. Better front camera. Mostly we use tablet for video calls meeting. If samsung has provided much better than camera than it would have been amazing. But it has better front camera than iPad 7th generation or mini.
2. Display should has been super amoled.

Overall, it is a fantastic tablet for average user. I will recommend for professionals, students and household people. Most of us are average user like to watch movies social media play some games browse internet and it will deliver everything smoothly.
If you are professional fashion designer, architecture or fine artist than I'll recommend tab S7+ or ipdad air 4th or ipdad pro.

Just go ahead buy and it is better than ipads 7th generation which more expensive this and deliver similar performance.

Don't waste money on overpriced products. Look what's your requirements and based on that buy products.",5
"Great product by samsung at this price range with S pen included in box. If you are looking for mid range tab then go for it.

Don't knw somhow I am not able to prebook my cover. I followed same precedure given by Amazon but it says offer not valid .. anyone facing se issue?",4
"Pros

Beast tablet for people looking for media and studying and other multi tasking
As processor is low end , High end games like pubg fornite is impossible and apps as well
Display is awesome even though it is not sAmoled
Chargering from 0 to 100 : 4hrs

Cons

1. S pen is ok but looking cheap

3. Palm rejection only works in samsung notes

I received on Wednesday 24june 2020
I ordered galaxy buds+ Friday morning as it activated today for device
I feel some facing issues with redemption
Don't worry i also faced same as serial number error and after 2 days i got offer",5
"Pencil which I received with this tablet the nip is not good .if u put pressure on it the nip get damage easily and no replacement nip are available in the market. About gaming not at all good for gaming purpose .
If u r a student and want to use it for study go for it .",3
"Pros:

1. Bubdled with S pen
2. S pen is very responsive. No need to charge like apple pencil. Quick launch button on s pen is very useful
3. Unlike iPad, Expandable storage is a great plus.
4. Good front camera quality.

Cons
1. Takes long time for charging
2. Image stabilization for video recording is not up to the mark",5
"I am happy with the product BUT, i have noticed from day 1 the back of the tab below camera is heating up frequently, even with slightest operation and during charging also.
I have not installed any heavy apps, nor any games yet. This this is irritating me, and happens with slightest usage.
Any suggestions/opinions?
Else, the product works and looks perfect.",3
"I am using this tab for last 2 months,
It is a good product , screen quality is good the feel is quite premium, decent camera quality. Thing I am disappointed is with charging speed.. it takes just less than 4hr for a full charge which is a shame.. means i keep this up for charging averagely for 3hrs every day..
Samsung should have offered a fast charger along with this it mind you Samsung This thing is not cheap to ignore the fast charger,....Other wise this is a good product.",2
"The device is perfect alternative for IPad's and not only that it also gives a tough competitive head-on-head with IPad. The biggest advantage is S-Pen which comes with package and does not require any charging. This S-Pen works so effortless with device that if someone who loves note taking and designing/sketching can play with this device.
The face unlock and the home page could've been better and also the charging too it takes hours to get fully charged. The screen could've been better as how the Super AMOLED screens the galaxy phones have. Otherwise, the device runs smoothly and UI is pretty neat, also special mention to the build quality of the device which feels so premium in hands.
Final word, if you are not Apple person then this is your answer. SIMPLY AWESOME.",5
"The tablet is fine. It does the job. Looks good and performs well considering the price.

The s-pen nib however is a little bent. It too works just fine. Many people have received defective s-pens. I don't know if Samsung thought to just save the defective ones for the India launch.

I am disappointed with Samsung's way of doing business here. Minus one star for doing this to so many customers.",3
"After 5 days uses what I found-
1-Rear camera is very poor,Front camara is Kamchalu.
2-Screen is good.
3-Design is superb.
4-Volume and sound quality is superb.
5-battery life is very good.
6- Connectivity is good did not face any issues.
7- Having ""S""pen in this range of tab is make you surprise, pen works properly you can do lots of stuff with this S pen .
So only what I dont like in this tab is the Camara quality apart of this every think is Rocking in this Tab . So as rating I give 4 out of 5 star.",4
"So i am a content creator on YT. So i basically need a tab to explain topics in my videos. So if you are using it for Notes and studies it is prefect tab in this budget. I am using it since last 1 month it is completely doing it's job.

I have made many videos with the help of this tab. You can check my chennal FinTaxPro where in latest videos i generally use this tab and this really improve the productivity.

One more thing, i was considering to go with ipad as well buy there are 2 major problems which i found.
1. Price difference (also you need to buy apple pencil separately but S pen üñä is inside the box with no extra cost(
2. Charging pen could be a problem if you take long sessions as apple pencil need to charge.

Rest i have not use this samsung tab for gaming at all but yes i had already used ipad for gaming and i don't think samsung could ever beat ipad in gaming area.

Vivek",5
The screen is TFT but the colors and brightness are sufficiently accurate. There is no noticable pixelation under standard viewing angles. The battery is good. With battery saver you get very long standby times - 5% per day. The pen is accurate but has a tiny bit delayed response. The chip is not good for gaming. You can mirror ur tablet to ur gaming pc and play pc games in it with a controller.,4
"After using this tablet for 6 months I am giving this review..it has a product defect that the tablet gets locked...first time when it happened initially I thought that I would have forgotten my password and had to do a factory reset..this time all of a sudden it happened yesterday..my family members knows the password since we are using it for online classes..to my surprise it got locked and not taking the correct password..got restarted on its own and unlocked but still I was not able to reset the password since for resetting as well it was asking for current password..now samsung remote unlock is also not working ...totally pissed off..this time I know for sure that I am entering the correct password since my husband also knows it.I have used so many mobile devices, tablets laptops ..this has never happened...it's a major product bug",1
"I compared many tablets for my usage and needs and finally went ahead with this one.

Pros:
- Display
I know its not IPS or Amoled, but even with a TFT screen it looks pretty good and I didn't find much issues with the viewing quality. The screen size is just about right for entertainment or learning.
- Battery
This is a monster I tell you, 7040 mAh is more than enough to last a day with average use.
- Camera
You dont buy tablets for their camera but, it has a good camera considering its a tablet, even the front camera I found was better than most tablets and can be comfortably used for video calling.
- Sound
Sound is sublime, it has good amplitude and with stereo speakers by akg and dolby atmos, there's not much to complain.
- Build
The build quality on this one is pretty good and it does give you that premium feeling.
- Memory
4gb RAM and 64gb ROM are more than sufficient for normal usage, if you use it for entertainment or learning or office work, you can definitely multi task and it comes with cloud storage on top of that.
- App noise
I did not find much bloatware or ads on this and a lot of pre installed apps can be uninstalled.
- Bang for buck
There are not many good tablets in a lower range that have 4gb 64gb specs.
Lenovo 2nd gen FHD plus is good but doesnt have good battery.
Huawei mediapad m5 is an exceptional tablet except that its Huawei. :P
Samsung A7 is pretty good but the memory spec is lower.
I was gonna go for Lenovo chromebook duet but its front camera is just 2gb and also chrome os does not support some android apps, it supports most but not all, also its like a keyboard vs spen thing for you to choose. It is good for people who use it more for productivity and office.
So finally went with this and got it for 23878 INR after Hdfc credit card discount + exchange offer.

Cons:
- S pen
The S pen does feel like it might not last long, only time will tell and you might want to be careful with how you handle it. Use it gently or it will get worn out fast and you don't have replacement tips too.
- Processor
It has the Exynos processor which is known for its inefficiency as compared to its counterparts.
It is not a gaming tablet, you can play games definitely but high end games might not run that smoothly.
- UI
Samsung UI is not the best but does the job just fine.

How to avail the buds+ offer?
(The process is a little unclear, so follow along)
If you are eligible and have bought it in the offer period,

1. Install Samsung shop app on the tablet itself.
2. Login via samsung account, it does an auto login on the tablet and enter the mobile number used for purchasing on amazon (preferably).
3. Go to 'For you' tab on the app and it should show S6 Lite offers and enter serial number on the tab and it will show available offers.
4. Click on buds+ and place your order.

The samsung chat support is pretty active and they should be helpful in case you find trouble with this.",5
"Till now best tab within 30k, for reading books and taking notes, display quality could have been better so it's not that great for watching videos, camera average, otherwise premium feel, slick design, s-pen will provide you nice experience if you consider it for reading and taking notes or editing it. I loved it.",4
"Excellent uni metal body finish. But lacks power due to 4 GB Ram. But good enough for student use and light home use.
I've used to for office work on Teams , Outlook and no issue at all, except it can get sometimes laggy.",3
I bought this for my daughter's online class purpose. So we use it for 2.5hrs where in the battery drains more than 50% which is the only drawback which I found. It could have been better is what I felt. Screen size is the best thing what I like. To conclude with overall it's a nice product.,5
Received my S6 Lite Tab and the s-pen nib is frayed,3
"I bought this tablet for Note taking as primary function and it really has come through. Great battery backup, and amazing features for note taking while using samsung notes. Best part is the free S pen.
Camera quality is average. No fingerprint sensor.

Only cons for me are
No fast charger. It takes a lot of time to get charged.
No Amoled dispay, but that would have brought the price up.

If you are a student and looking a good note taking device primarily, then don't think much and go for it.",4
"Good tablet. Overpriced for what it can do. Performance is above average but not that great if you're charging upper mid range smartphone like money then offer a decent chipset too. If you want to compete with the iPad then just expandable memory won't help. I bought it for kids to have a bigger screen for online classes but the very average chipset makes it just that.

Performance: very average, not snappy, disappointed
Screen: very good
Storage: very good
Battery life: very good
Xtra features: S pen is good to have but not necessary",4
Eveeythigs awesome how to avail the prebook offer for the galaxy buds though ...my serial nunbe risnt recognised yet ...is this normal or should I get the device changed,3
"Great for drawing. S pen has great accuracy, nib has a good rub against the screen, doesnt slip, latency is not that recognisable given the price, samsung notes and draw apps have great optimisation .palm regection works decently. other apps like autodesk, clipstudio, infinite painter are also well optimised. Audio is superb, dolby atmos.Not as snappy as an ipad, its packing a moderate mid range exynos chip, might make it laggy in the long run with respect to gaming. Currently playing call of duty in high settings without issues, asphalt 9 in medium without lag, high setting cause frame drop occasionally...drawing , animation and note taking experience is really good.",5
"Best tablet I've played with. OK, I'm sure if I bought the really expensive Samsung or Surface Pro (or iPad) I might find them a little quicker or slightly better screen or sound but, I VERY much doubt they would be worth the extra money. This really is a gorgeous tablet. It is soooo light too and it is even thinner than my Galaxy Note 9 !!",5
"I won‚Äôt hit around the bush..straight to the point I‚Äôll write in here:
Talking about the tab as in general, is absolutely stunning and made with good grades.. no complaints regarding the hardware and also th√© inbuilt software platform.
The only thing i would like to bring into notice is the S Pen...it‚Äôs good but there‚Äôs no replacement tips nor a replacement for the S Pen is available for the Indian customers.

If anyone in here has some replacement ideas please share, as i am constantly into digital art and i need a replacement for the S Pen",5
Usually when you buy a tab you get it in plastic wrap on the box and what I received was a box with out the plastic wrap and just a seal sticker applied on the box. I confirmed that the item is used when I saw the user manual present in the box crumpled. Though the tab didn‚Äôt had any defects but still paying for a new tab and getting a used one is just depressing to see.,2
I didn't find any problems after using it for a year (only for reading pdf Kindle and note taking) but the only thing is stylus. I cannot buy new stylus or replacement,3
"Nice experience with tab, sometimes laging in processing but there must be some serious quality improvement in s-pen.
Tip of s-pen is quite delicate. You will have to use it very carefully.
So it's totally depends upon your budget.
For low budget: It's good.
If your can wear higher cost go for higher version or i-pad.",4
The tab is really good..I love the screen resolution thr battery backup is also really good..the sound is next level...the gaming ummm i tired playing asphalt it is getting stuck a bit..may b due to the processor that samsung is using bt overall at this price point its a great deal..go for it,5
"Everything is wonderful about this tablet. Pen is pretty much smooth. But there is lag during writing. But it will not bother after some time. Screen is good. Brightness is perfect. In one charge tab will work for 2 and half days with normal stuff. Camera is OK. It has stereo speaker. Sound quality is top notch. Best part is seen is free. It is very much smooth in writing and holding the pen. I have forgotten to touch the screen with my finger. I was only worried about the spen but after using this I will say it is in the same category of apple pencil as I have also used apple pencil. Spen has a sharp tip, it will help you during writting and drawing.",5
"I Preferred This Tab Over I Pad And It Didn't Disappoint Me.
Received Software Update Just After First Boot . New Software Update Includes Brightness Level Control And Double Tap Wake Up Feature.
Overall Performance Is Quite Good. Battery Life Superb.
Pre-Book Offer Is Available Till 31st August.Check Samsung Shop App For Details Of The Pre-Book Offer.
Buy It Without Second Thought As This Is The Best Available Tablet Under 30K.",5
"This product is a great on just the s-pen was defective(which may be a big problem for some people but one should buy if you subsequently want it for classes, notes as well as gaming and to give you a little bit more information it runes Call Of Duty at MAX available graphics without any lags and Fortnite too at low settings.
One should buy if need for the above mentioned uses.
JUST TAKE A LOOK AT THE S-PEN BECAUSE IT CAME DEFECTIVE FOR 90%OF THE PEOPLE.",4
Don't buy this product. Even HD videos look hazy. I asked for refund with in a week. Ipad is the best but mo whatsapp in that. U should look for other ones. Please check in store and then take a decision,1
"Best budget android tab with android 11. Bit slow at times. But serves purpose of using it for videos, book reading, notes etc.. do not know as i am not interested to play games on tab but even if you do, considering specs it can support with low or medium graphics settings.
Volume is good. Surround sound with dolby atmos is super awesome.. i have never had such best experience with any other device claiming dolby atmos unless you put on headset but his tab is superb with speakers too. 3.5 mm jack and gsm slot its super combo.
Highly recommended",5
"S pen works just fine, I can evaluate image answersheets :) like real evaluations... Could recommend voice enhancement while watching movies with more than 1 person.. overall satisfied battery life - daily once recharge required. Using WiFi model. Screensaver is my personal.",5
"I am using this tablet since 4 days and Almost done every test from gaming to Netflix and Studying everything.

Camera :- I think at this price point This tab has its best camera. Althogh who uses a camera on Tab ? But for some scanning purpose or taking some daylight shots its Good .

Display:- I dont say its best . But its good overall.

Speed :- You get 2+GB of RAM free Out of 4 GB avail. And Gaming is smooth i played Pubg and Asphalt they are very smooth . Some times you will face a lag if you Play Asphalt at higher Quality.

Sound:- Best. Its Bass and Treble is soo good , While watching movies , its gives so Thrill and Goosebumps to hear that bass from a Mid Range Device. Its best best best.

S Pen :- I saw some of reviews in which They compared it with apple Pencil and Ipad . So if you are usiing samsung Note to take your notes Its good. But If you move pen so fast in zig zag u'll se a small gap.
**But this Is only visible in Samsung NOTE. Squid and Microsoft ONENOTE make its Smooth so over all if i give apple pencil 5/5. Then i'll also give S Pen with Tab S6lite 4.5/5.

Face Recognition :-It works in 95% cases. And if you have Closed your eyes it wont open. So its Good.

Overall i'll give this tablet 9/10.
Its best in this price (Tab s6lite with Spen)

Battery:- With Gaming , Studying , Youtube it survived 3 days.
Also Charge faster than Samsung A50 (my smartphone)",5
"This is a brilliant tab. In this price range when IPad has only 32gb storage and no Expandability, Samsung brings a charm with 1TB Expandability Amazing with stylus and good speed with 4 gb ram. I do not find any cons for this tab as of now. I would suggests to all those who want to work with stylus, which is light as a pencil and great feel while writting on the tab.",5
"Product is very delicate, breaks even after fall from 1 ft height..buy ipad instead",1
I received my tablet on this Tuesday. Packaging was good but the pen comes with this tablet called S-Pen was damaged. You can check photos uploaded by me here along with this comment. Highly disappointed with seller.,1
"The best performing tab in its price range. The Exynos 9610 is a great mid range SOC. Used in the A series phones as well, performs exceptionally well in the S6 lite Tab as well. 4 GB RAM is sufficient for most tasks, unless you are a heavy multi Tasker. Samsung One UI 3.1 keeps the OS operation very smooth. A great media consumption device overall.",5
It's just too slow. webpages load . a lot slower than a Middle Ranger smartphone . The peu was also finicky en the beginning.Now its okay.But not impressive.. just So so. Tu my opinion even or catry level ipad is better than this.,2
"I bought this tablet because of S pen only..
nd s pen is broken.
Nd there is no replacement nibs..

please Solve this hurry",1
The best economic tablet. Perfect for students. I regret buying the grey one as the other colours are awesome. I thought the tip of spen was frayed. But I'm using it till now! Just a reminder you need not go for other note taking apps as samsung notes is the best. The version which you get with the tab is old. And update it from 'GALAXY STORE' not play store!,5
"Screen resolution could be little better. Got Android 11 , one ui 3.1 out of the box. S pen functionality is good. Battery backup is fine. Sound is fine. Dex mode is built in, good for note taking, watching videos and light gaming. Camera quality is just ok.",4
"Best tablet with stylus in this price range. Good for those who take so much notes or, who are fond of drawing. But if you write so fast then it may lag to process the writing. The s pen tip is of soft material. So it may damage over time. And there is no replacement of tips in the box, which is disappointing. But overall good package.",4
"Not as good as a 6th Gen iPad.
The pen is more like a perishable add-on. Their pen on note 2 still works, can't say the same for the one with this tab. A bit disappointed with Samsung of late.",3
"Have already used tabs worth 20k working flawlessly , and here comes S series lite. Let down at the price. Not so happy with it as the performance and navigation across tablet is laggy at times. Specially when opening it after a while.
Camera quality is not good for indoor
Outdoor is like 7 out of 10
Plays video apps properly though.

Loved the S Pen üñä... best thing in the tan.",3
"Review written after one day of use :-
Pros
1. Value for Money with S-pen
2. s-pen works like a dream
3. No lag during gaming
4. Handles multi task well
5. Hand writing recognition is awesome and no lag in pen
6. Best for studying and note taking
7. Decent Camera

Cons
None that I faced other than S-pen doesn't stick well on left side and It doesn't have inbuilt MS office .. Not able to use Ms Word for editing . It doesn't give me option of editing and pop up appears saying update Ms office 365..",5
Overall tablet is good but camera quality is very bad the image clicked by front and back camera is quite pixelated and blurry not for video chat and amazon service executive inspected the tab and said that can't do anything with the camera issue it's manufacturers fault quite disappointed by Amazon will not buy any other products from Amazon switching to flipkart they at least would've resolved my issue,2
"+Pros:
‚Ä¢Super built quality (aluminum)
‚Ä¢Good display (tft)
‚Ä¢Nice stereo speakers (akg)
‚Ä¢Useful S-pen (magnetic)
‚Ä¢10,000 mah battery with (10w charger only)
-Cons:
‚Ä¢Exynos 9611-(average processor) not at all
Upto 2.3ghz Justifiable for this price.
‚Ä¢No 25w fast charger in the box
‚Ä¢60hz refresh rate only must have given atleast 90hz.
‚Ä¢only 4gb ram they should have given min 6gb.
‚Ä¢No extra rubber tips for S pen
‚Ä¢sound quality is very good but volume is not that loud as expected.
Overall experience
A decent tablet for students to attend online classes and for content consumption.
Nice for taking notes.
It is not a gaming tablet.
Great software and great built quality.",4
"I like the tab. I am a first time tab user. Like the s-pen. I am little worried about the tip. Battery is ok but since i didn't use tab before i can't tell its performance. Camera is good.

I like the screen recorder options, Dex mode, samsung notes to create botes with s-pen. LTE+ support. Screen quality is good.

Pen sticking to side is good.
It would be better if they give better RAM options.

Thanks Appario Retail.",5
"It's a great deal.
The S Pen works effortlessly.
The only problem I came across is with the tablet charger as it does not support fast charging.
So you need to charge it with another fast charge.
If you want to use it for study purpose it's the best choice.
For Pre Book Offer-
Wait for 48-72hrs after activation of your tab.",5
"Battery life is very awesome. It gives more than 10 hrs of video playback on full charge. (On low to medium brightness)
It is truly value for money feal as compared to other android tablets especially because of that in box s pen.
Speakers üîä are enough loud and surprisingly clear. Display is also good even though it is a TFT panel.
S pen also works well, but sometimes you may notice delay.
But I have noticed lag while multitasking. Also it's exynos 9611 is not sufficient for heavy gaming.
You may see frequent framedrops while playing pubg.
In short, if you are considering it for multimedia consumption or online classes, then it is perfect choice.",5
"Loved this tab with performance..build quality is all metal feels premium design,smooth touch, sound quality is excellent with dolby atmos. TFT screen some play Store apps are not optimized with this tab...Charging takes 3-4 hours to get 100%..S-pen not designed for heavy use..
Face unlock does not work sometimes.",4
"Pros --
1. Long battery life
2. Good performance
3. Good for gaming as well.
In pubg --
(i). You will get extreme fps on smooth
(ii). You will get ultra fps on hdr
4. Display quality is good. Screen size is good.
5. Speaker sound is good (base is good)
6. S pen is very interactive and responsive
7. Design is good comparing to others
8. Finishing is also good
9. Well know company (samsung) product

Cons --
1. It takes almost 3-4 hours to get fully charged
2. Camera quality is not that good
3. No screen protection

Overall this is a good product. Recommends to buy this product.",4
Wonder device. Been using for over a month. Had apprehension about shifting from an IPad to android; but...it's good and versatile to use. Happy buying the S6.,5
"Writing review after 2 months. One of the best tablet for day to day usage. Battery life is very good. Gaming is fine with a bit of stutter here and there but i don't game much. Tab feels fast and responsive. S pen is its usp and it delivers at that front pretty good. Its responsive when writing and palm rejection is also good. Speakers are very loud and have good separation and fine depth. Samsung software has a lot of features for using the screen area for multiple apps, although i don't use multiple apps but yeah it's optimized well.
Screen quality is good no complaints there. Cameras are not that good should had been better: front cam is just fine but rear one is not that good.
Tab feels premium, solid and has a slim profile adding to its quality. Multitasking works as 4-5 apps can be kept in background.
One negative is that its Spen tip is now kind of worn off so that's a concern as there is no replacement tip. Will try to get from service center if that is possible.
One can definitely go with it if s pen / writing is main concern. Also its decently powerful so can be used extensively as well, there might be just few hiccups here n there but will work good.
But if just want to watch movies and stuff then its a bit pricey, there are new options from Samsung itself now and others as well, should save some money and go with them.
All in all its a good tablet, giving premium feel and lots of tricks up its sleeves.",5
The Tablet size is okay for reading but it's bit too heavy for its size and that makes it uncomfortable to use while holding. This can be solved by taking a foldable stand type cover. The charging takes like forever and should have had rapid or dash charging at this price range. This laptop cannot use SIM card so check carefully before Purchasing.,3
"Love the look of the tablet. It's good for watching videos, reading, general entertainment. Work wise - you can do basic to mid level research and writing work on it, way better than your phone for on the go use. If your use for a laptop is just basic document viewing, email, basic writing and entertainment then this is a very logical alternative. Not a replacement for laptop if you want to do some serious typing(unless you get a Bluetooth keyboard), and your work requires you to use speciality software like CMS, Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere Pro etc.

Pen: The pen is a very good addition. Can be used to do light doodling and designing work. Low level pro work is also possible but now advisable as the tip of the pen feels like it will flaten like a pencil if used extensively and too aggressively. Extremely useful when editing photos on apps like Lightroom. It's a better feeling alternative for touching the screen directly. Overall a good add-on.

Performance: I'm not much of a much of a mobile gamer so can not comment on that but in general if you have too many apps open the tablet starts feeling glitchy. Over heated one or twice but not a big deal. In a the AutoCAD design app that I use for doodling if there are too many layers and the file is too large the app sometimes just hangs and shuts down. But you can't expect iPad Pro or Tab S7 performance at this price.

A producer's perspective: it is a very good tool to carry around on shoots and work. I also bought a Targus BT keyboard with it so I can easily do extensive typing on it. Good to have at shoots to reffer to scripts and pointers and at times look up videos on the go on a bigger screen instead of your phone. Also a good tool to showcase your work in a non-formal meeting.

Conclusion: If you are looking for an alternate device with your heavy duty PC/Laptop for just light use and entertainment then go for it.",4
"This is just worth the money. Ideal for students... touch screen and the pen provided has great response. Very easy to make notes. Very easy to write and organise your notes. Several features of samsung notes app makes it easier. But i guess the response is great only for Samsung note app and not in evernote, but that's okay as Samsung notes app is much much better than evernote. Multiple screens can be kept open with the several useful features such as pop up view. Camera also works well. Great speakers. Experience Dolby atomos work beautifully, the true surround experience.
No ads like in redmi or vivo.
Light weight.
My sole purpose was note making reading etc and this is perfect. Cant comment on gaming. The specs are sufficient for that( reading, note taking, watching a movie etc).

If you are a student or teacher, this is the best tab available in market. Online classes made easier.
eg: Screen shots of ppts can be taken and extra points told by teachers could be wrote.. check the last picture i have uploaded.
But i would advice you to buy the lte variant of this model.

Yet to discover other useful features... Will update if any problems are found
Great buy!
~Sreejith",5
"It's very easy to use as all the options are same like your mobile phone and with expandable memory. If you are OK with the screen configuration as we can't compare with Apple tabs, it's very easy to use. Ipads are not at all comfortable in most of the aspects as I am using Ipads with different generations for the past 12 years. I am feeling very very comfortable.",5
"It's a really great tablet with almost all the things that are expected from a tablet.
It has very good battery life i charge it once every 2-3 days
Very loud and good quality speakers even at half volume
Camera quality is good for a tablet
Very bright screen
Takes around 4 hrs to charge from 0%
Never heats up except charging
Good for light gaming but not for heavy games
It's been a month since i am using it and it us performing perfectly
S Pen is of good quality but its ok
Great device in this price rangr the only downside is that it doesn't have kayboard connector slot
Other tham that i can recommend it easily to every one",5
"I am a first time user of a tablet. This tablet ticks well on all my needs like reading books and explaining things in online meetings. YT looks just too good on tablet as compared to mobile phone. I do not play games neither watch movies so can't say much on this aspect but yeah one drawback of this tablet is that sometime it get momentarily hanged and its touch don't responds.

Otherwise this is good tablet.",5
"Review after 4 days:
Battery is good. Smooth. Fast response. Camara is ok.

Pen tip is bad. It must be little more sturdy. It bends and one has to be extremely careful in using it.

No pen slot like in Note which is highly troublesome.",5
"I've been using it for viewing and marking pdfs, writing notes since 4 days. I'm not a gamer and I occasionally watch videos. The speakers are powerful enough. The display is not AMOLED as mentioned by other customers. Though it doesn't bother me much. This tab is good for academic purpose, though I felt palm rejection couldve been a little better while using the pen on the PenUp drawing app. The S pen works good on the already installed write on Pdf app. Battery life is awesome. I charge it once every 2 days. Fast charger doesn't come with this pack. Overall I liked it.",4
"On the details of the product, it is mentioned that Country of Origin is India. But the product I received, its mentioned that Country of origin is Vietnam. This is a complete violation of recent Indian regulations which says about mentioning of Country of origin.",3
"Well, this review is based on just 1 month usage. However, I am feeling like I made a very good decision buying this tab. It replaced my laptop and phone entirely in all my entertainment & hobby purpose- video watching, reading & writing. And in turn now I do not need to charge my phone multiple times a day--saving my phone battery health. Also because I own a samsung phone; call, message, file transfer and screen casting works seamlessly between this tab and my phone. I am very happy with this tab.",5
"My children are very happy to use the same for studying & attending online classes.Good one.they could have offered a book case for a reasonable price as 4500 is toomuch for a book cover. Hope 3rd party vendors will come out with a budet book case. I have opted for buds+ offer.
Thank you samsung.eventhough i dont like your pricing strategy...i am always buying your products as i am quite satisfied with their quality and durability.",5
Very good tablet .. for medical students marrow run smoothly and note taking option is there ... You can enjoy books pdf on large screen ... I donot use it in gaming purpose... Battery is good enough lasts for 1 day after heavy use..camera is satisfactory... Performance is jabardast. S pen is in intact situation no damage found. Highly recommended for study purpose,4
"Its a decent tab specially with S Pen. Samsung is a bit pricy but you get the unique thing which no other brands provide. The tab is very nice for media consumption and mild editing works and few games. Please bear in mind that this has a mid range processor which should be able to handle normal tasks easily. This is not meant for heavy apps. Regarding SPen, its very smooth and I love note taking with it. I see some lag when it comes to sketching but manageable.",4
" I am first time tablet user when I hold tab heavy but I used 2-3 it seems fine screen it is very good tab at this budget is excellent with non rechargeable S pen pressure sensitive very good,there no lag in S pen great for artist and note taking I think it's okay not for heavy gamer for Bing watching might be cause stress to eye display back light brightness hearts no eye care display over all at this range not better than this

Image and video which uploaded is seems distorted but when we see with naked there noting display quality great 9.5/10 don't worry trust me

If possible visit Samsung store to feel and touch quality you love with tab definitely",4
" Awesome tablet for the price, but the product I received was faulty and stopped working after 3 days. Initially it was rebooting on its own, but eventually ended up being stuck on the boot screen and eventually died. Thankfully replacement window was open so I ordered the replacement. But the Amazon replacement policy is pathetic tbh..

The pickup agent came and denied pick-up bcz the device could not switch on (which is my concern/complaint for replacement), So had to return it.

The real horror starts here, the next pick-up agent picked up the device and initiated return. He checked the device thoroughly, but after some time called up saying device not switching on, and he will hv to pay from his pocket if it doesn't. And finally said he's getting it repaired in aftermarket, and keeping the device for his personal use. üòí",1
"The product is good for it's price but it's not the best. I'll tell you why :
1) Screen: It is really poor for multimedia consumption. YouTube videos on 1080p are not watchable but downloaded movies are good somehow. The screen is perfect for studies, I use pdf notes, chrome and I love the experience of it.
2) Battery : Poor charging speed. It takes about 4+ hrs to charge from 0-100 and the battery backup is not the best either. But I generally charge early in the morning till 80-90% and then end up with 30+% with decent usage of Youtube, chrome and Bluetooth ""on"" most of the time.
3) Accesories : Bought a back cover and screen guard from Robustron and they're the best for this tablet. Also bought a C-type to Usb adaptor.
Got Samsung Buds+ on offer for 2k and it is pure gold. I was never really interested in using true wireless earphones but I have to say I'm addicted to it. It is also good for gym use.
4) Software : Always loved Samsung software, simple and minimalistic. Supports dark mode and many other features. (Pro tip : Download One hand operation+ from play store).
And ofc it is Android so you get all the goodness of it, right from downloading pirated apks to the ease of access. Also, Samsung said it would provide 2 more major android updates so it should be fine for the next 3yrs.
5) DeX : It is alright, not the best in terms of performance. Mouse clicks don't work properly on DeX, have to click 2 times to open something. Don't know if it is mouse problem or Dex problem. But yes, pair it with a mouse and a keyboard to get that laptop experience.
6) Performance : Ranging between poor to average. Gets poor once in a while since it is using not so powerful chipset. But for an average browsing experience it should be fine.
7) Gaming : Played PES ( Pro Evolution Soccer) and it couldn't handle it at high settings. It should be running fine on a 30k device but well what can we do?
8) S- Pen : It is milessss ahead of Apple Pencil. Apple Pencil feels like you're writing with plastic on your screen but S-Pen writes so smoothly and effectively that it's unparalleled. Bonus point is that it's free.
Personally, I've never used the S-Pen on purpose but it's great to take notes on the Samsung Notes app ( I still have a S-Pen with a bad tip though).
9) Amazon : Amazon doesn't care about the products it is sending out. Got broken S-Pen twice and they wouldn't want to replace it again. Had to keep the tablet since WiFi model wasn't available anywhere offline. Only Croma had it but you don't have the Buds+ offer.
Verdict : Only buy if you want a cheap yet decent Android tab only for simple usage. Lacks when compared to iPad 8th gen. in screen, performance and excels otherwise.",3
"S pen which comes with the tab has some issues. Its nib is defective, it isn't uniform 360¬∞ . it's kinda frayed . Want to replace.",3
"All looks good so far, as described. The only issue I must highlight is that Samsung packs a really underpowered travel adapter with the tab. I don't know why. Takes a whopping 4 hours for complete charge. Even my One Plus 6t has a better adapter. What's worrying is the details of the adapter are missing in the description everywhere.

S pen is something kids may love to play with. It's useful for artists too. Well, it's little heavier to feel comfortable, but a metal body and higher capacity battery should justify this.

Overall, a good deal, except for the travel adapter.",4
"It is a great multimedia device. Good screen, good speakers. Where it lacks is performance. You will be able to open only 2 or 3 apps simultaneously. More than these apps open leads to hangs and stutters. The stylus provided inside works well. And with apple you will have to shell out 8k more. So this is definitely cost effective for people who are looking to use stylus.

Overall I would say go with Apple Ipad which is only 2k over this. And will work much better.",3
"Little expensive for this configuration. Ideal price for this tab is around 18-20K max.

While the TAB does the job flawlessly, performance could have been a little better (Processor / RAM).

Overall OK in the current situation as there are no other better options available in the market in this price range.",4
"After 1 week of use the tablet is excellent and s-pen is the most awesome thing kudos to Samsung.

Only Issue i could see is the cheap travel charger that comes with the tablet, using that one it could take years to charge even if the tab supports fast charging. I replaced it with fast charger, and now the tab is charging super fast.",4
"Good overall.

Though it's not a sAMOLED , still the screen is enjoyable. 4k runs smooth. Samsung has cut corners to give you the best user experience.

Pen experience is not that great but you will be happy using it for daily note taking.

And for those wondering about for pre-book offers, it will take one or two days to reflect on your samsung Shop app which you can download in samsung app store.

I wanted to give 4 stars , just because of the included pen i am giving 5.",5
"Product is good but the charge delivered with is defective. Its not charging the unit.
advised by Amazon tech team to visit Samsung service for replacement.
Amazon is not replacing the unit nor the charger.I had to make several calls.
Also delivered without invoice. I had to take support in understanding to download invoice copy",4
This is the best tablet in this price range it access the s pen experience for you which is considered as the prime features in premium tablets and note series from Samsung Electronics. This is definitely a better choice than the ipad but if you are looking for premium just buy the s7 tab series which is runs way better chipset . This is the current best midrange tablet available in 2020 . It also comes with 2 years of guaranteed android update with one user interface ( one UI). It is not good in photography ( as tablets are always ),5
Wifi bluetooth stopped working after 2 months and now i cant return the product for replacement because the return period is over. Going back and forth to near Samsung service centre. Bt the service they provide is garbage. My tab is stuck from 1 month in the service center.,1
I used to notice my kid rubbing her eyes when doing the classes on this tab.. never so on laptop or even phone.. Recently she complained of seeing distant text blurry.. Now we are struggling to get her sight normal.. Have just stated the facts here nothing subjective,1
"All the things don't matter if it cant survive a half feet drop even with a case , dont buy Samsung's hardware always gonna suck !!",1
"Awesome performance tab in a tight budget.
Pros:
1. Works great for entertainment, study purpose.
2. Samsung Notes app is just the next level and is the key difference maker between this tab and others. Apple iPad 7th and 8th Generation don't provide S-pen in the box, Plus no charging headache for the pen.
3. Battery is super cool, a big battery üîã for a big device.
4. Great reading experience.

Cons:
1. S-pen looks weak though nothing happened.
2. Big battery needs a fast charger.",5
"The S pen, Dolby Atmos sound, the ability to play 4K videos at high FPS and Dark Mode are the most attractive features. It has a very high quality display...4K videos on this device are a treat for the eyes. The screen is visually stunning....Make sure you buy a Samsung Evo Plus microSD card to increase the storage...",5
"Excellent Purchase.The spen is of great use.The device has a laminated display and the dual speakers from AKG are just awesome!.No lag till now (using it for past 7 days).The battery is also great.I use to have online classes and the battery still will have 30%-40% at the end of the day.
Main drawback is that it does not have a sAMOLED display but the laminated display is excellent. The face recognition finds a break sometimes.Overall good product at this range.",4
"Bought it for my dad, and he has replaced his laptop very much with samsung tab s6 lite for all his office and personal use..!
He said he likes it and its been very handy.

If you are not a hard gamer or multitasker.. just mails, excel sheets, documents, pdf, movies, browsing and lite games you want then this is a perfect tab to go for..! Plus it has an S-pen..!",5
"Using since 2 months, overall product performace like battery backup, display, camera is good. But not suitable for kids (upto 6 years) online classes because of microphone.",5
"Bottom left corner of the screen is getting hot, I replaced that and now got the replacement but the replacement has the same problem. It's annoying while taking notes when more then half of the screen is cold and a specific part is hot then rest of the screen. Who else getting the same problem ?",3
"Product is good but overpriced by around 10,000.
because, its just a TFT display and no fast charger given along with thebox. (Just ordinary charger in the box)",1
"Wanted a tablet with s-pen feature and not very pricey. Galaxy tab s6 lite serves the purpose very well. Got this on 17 October. Will review it further.

Initial observeation:

1. 7000mah battery is awesome
2. Sound output from dual speaker is fabulous
3. S-pen works hassle free.",5
"I had bought this for online classes.
Volume:if you switch on your fan and take classes without earphones then volume is low.
Cameras:both front and back cameras are average .
Battery:4-5hrs continues usage battery is low.
Charging:takes 3-4 hrs for full charge.",3
You will get the worst display.,1
"I am using oneplus 6t along with this tab. So you will definitely find lags if you are using any flagship (snapdragon 845 and above ) . but these lags are not very regular.
You can't enjoy pubg like in apple iPad (7th generation). The only reason I decided to buy it for the open-source Android. I can transfer pdf from my phone to tab with ease that all. And for note-making, I try to write some notes and it is a good experience.
So for all those who don't want gaming and just want it for notes making PDF AND entertainment stuff that its a good choice for you. But if you want performance and gaming go for I pad (7th gen) or iPad mini.",3
"I am a physics Teacher and find it good for teaching
purpose. Big screen give more space and comfort to write with s pen. Sound is also crisp with dolby atmos. Only one con that it seems to be little heavy. Also good for taking online classes, My 5 yrs old daughter too uses it for this purpose and can operate it herself. Earlier she used to take class on laptop which was difficult to operate for her.",5
I was not able to redeem pre booking offer. Called support and spent 6hrs but it keeps complaning serial number not eligible for the offer. Don't know why they had to make offer such complicated and not able to make it work. Didn't expect this from samsung ‚òπÔ∏è,1
"Pros.

First of all i want to thank flipkart for a good and fast delivery i mainly want to buy ipad but because of its unavailability i thought to buy it nd u know what this is my best decision ever there are many misconceptions that its processor is not upto the mark but the reality is according to this price its processor is awesome u can play games (pubg) ver efficiently and can do editing nd watch movies videos whatever u like its just like u have bought a multipackage machine also the s pen work pretty awesome u can easily carry the s pen as it has a very strong magnet even it can takeover the weight of the tablet abhi bhi soch rhe ho?? Cons.

Although it has all features are pretty good but there is not good camera i know that doesn't matter since no one take picture from a tablet but due to this the face unlock doesn't work accordingly so that is the first con second some apps are not optimized for the tab and it doesn't have a fast charger for a massive device like it",4
"Miss information about the product, you need to buy office 365.Samsung has this typical policy above 10 inches screen size MS office is not free. Complete waste of money.",1
First of all within few days the tab is giving problem like hanging issues while movies watching then I contact Amazon but the refused to give me replacement saying that product is out stock that kind of response in not acceptable,3
"The s pen feels like a s6 reject! I got it replaced twice! The tip was damaged every time! Had to retain it coz I got tired of requesting replacements.
Spend a bit extra and buy an iPad. Or save a lot by buying the A series tab instead. The s pen on this tab is a gimmick !!",2
"Hello everyone, I am a teacher, during lockdown Ihave been taking online classes I have rigorously weighting for this product (almost 20 days) Great product for the teachers and students,
Samsung given s-pen to write, draw anything and anywhere",5
"Delivered in less than 24hrs.
Earlier i was in dilemma whether to buy s6 lite or not but when i held this humongous tab in my hand, i was like ""paisa wasool tab hai ye"".
S pen working smoothly.
Bright display.
Everything you expect in a good tab, it's filled with it.
Front and rear camera not too bad like i read in other reviews.
Clicked good quality images in well lit room.
Overall, value of money, you won't be disappointed.
Thank you Amazon. ‚ò∫Ô∏è",5
"Very good tablet for day to day use.
May nit do a heavy lifting
SPen is advantage.
Good battery life
Good display.
Camera is average,don't expect much from camera.
Minimal default apps which is a good thing.
Long charging time.
Had to purchase cover separately,but for better maintenance, cover is a must.",4
"Except camera everything is working great, purchased it for my kid school and learning purpose, doesnt checked for games, pen is working however doesnt used much as some peoples give comments at if it is broken it is gone.

I love the sound most, it is very good.",4
"I ordered this tab on 12th April, 2021 and it's been delivered on 15 th. It was running fine but after a day's use it started showing touch problem. So I had to get a technician visit in my home and after that I returned the product.

Again I ordered it on 30th April and it was delivered on 2th May. This time only defect was I have received a frayed nib of the Spen out of the box.
Pros:
Battery life
Office works
Note taking (Obviously you will have trouble finding the replacement nibs for Spen from the Samsung)
Thats all I can say :)
Disappointed very much.....",3
"This review is after 2 weeks of usage of the tab

Bought it for my Birthday, this is the 1st time ever I purchased a tablet in my life that too from mt own salary, that too I spent such a big amount on Amazon. And guess what??

Yes yes its worth it.

Good for gaming, but don't download too many heavy size games. I have downloaded FIFA and Mortal Kombat as heavy games, working good.

Great for making notes and drawing.

Screen size is also good, high quality 4K/HD videos.

Best budget tab with good internal size, smoothness and features.",4
It's really good for students at this price who want to read and edit their material as well. The screen is big enough for almost no eye strain and also comes with blue cut mode which helps immensely. It's also good for watching movies on breaks as it comes with Dolby Atmos support.,4
"Product is made in Vietnam, but amazon shows its made in India. Amazon is misleading customers.",1
"This product is utter waste without SIM slot. By mistake I placed an order as ""WiFi only"" instead ""WiFi with LTE"". Even I contacted Amazon Support after it's delivery but no one was helpful and ready for the replacement even with additional differential price for ""WiFi with LTE"". My simple suggestion to you is don't think to buy anything from Amazon as it's not encouraging for any replacement. Not suitable for New Age Product Delivery and Practice.",1
"Overall brand wise it's good, the battery doesn't support much like i have to charge it daily, it's good for educational purpose i haven't installed any games in it so i can't review about gaming side, i have used major apps for designing purpose doesn't hang at all like previously i have used other brands,don't forget to buy a power bank with this you need more power when you travel with this.",5
"If you are planning to purchase only for digital notes and media consumption, then this product will be great. Regarding gaming, you could play in a medium setting otherwise it showing lagging. I'd purchased only for digital notes which is fine for me, no compromising you would see in this product.",4
"Bought it as gift for my grandmother. Extremely satisfied. Hours and hours of video calls, youtube and facebook without any hassle. Looks premium too.

All apps work without lags. Display is also good for the price. Better than buying chinese brands.",5
"Bitter experience.. the free s pen is a myth.. don't fall d trap.. either you get a damaged/frayed tip s pen or if you get an undamaged one it will be of low quality... My previous samsung tab has a way more premium stylus.. this is a name sake cheap stylus..
The sad part is I have replaced the product twice. Every time I got a damaged s pen

Screen as it's a TFT.. not so punchy

You can also count on how many reviews are there bout a broken s pen.. tats true

1.either go for ipad
2. Huawei mediapad if you need a stylus( but at d cost of old UI)",3
"Absolutely love this tab. Entire family uses it for various purposes. We study using it, kids have fun with Samsung kis app, we draw with s pen n create notes. We just LOVE this tab. :-).",5
"Holy heck. Best tablet I've ever seen. My family has ipad pro 10 and air. But I went for this n i can honestly say that it's better than those. I was a little skeptical about the s pen because of reviews, but it's just the plastic ending that looks like the s pen is scraped. No compromise on comfort or accuracy. Better than the 10k pencil of course",5
Samsung products always fascinate me and this is also a nice product from Samsung at range of 30000 rupees. Samsung is always pioneer in tablet market I am using Samsung galaxy S2 and compared to it drawbacks are there but overall nice product. display is good and functionality wise it's ok,5
"It has been three weeks. This tablet is pretty good for general use. Kids love it! The FHD display is quite good! 10"" display is really big & nice! Audio is good. Camera photos are good. In videos, the resolution is mediocre.
The stylus is very delicate & may break any day :-(
I would recommend this tablet!",4
"Great tablet for student use, not for heavy games, great for study, taking notes, doing online classes and reading and annotating PDFs and Kindle, and Netflix and youtube. Cons is Samsung doesn't provide extra nibs for the S Pen and the original nib may wear out with heavy use, so you may have to order it from third party sources, not easy though nibs of other S Pen work fine with it too. Go ahead and buy if you are on a budget buy and looking for an awesome tab.",4
"As a student, s6 lite is my workhouse. Everything is best whether display, battery,processor and my favourite S- pen. No issue yet after 7 months. It's good if u have a samsung phone then u will be able to use ""call and text on other device"".(for wifi only). Go for it, if u have budget around 27k.
Or increase ur budget :) . S-pen is the advantage for any kind of student.",5
"This is the best tablet in this price range.
Everything from the looks to usage is very good, only issue for me is the stylus. Stylus seemed to be already worn on one side when I opened the package.",4
"Intially I had a problem that My S pen writes without even touching display, that was quite irritating but after a restart couple of software updates, this started to work flawlessly. I will post more details
once I use it properly over weekend.",4
"Pros:
1. Good battery life.
2. Expandable storage upto 1TB.
3. S-Pen works flawlessly.
4. Stereo speakers are awesome.
Cons:
1. Exynos processor, should have given Snapdragon.
2. Face ID works only 80%, fingerprint sensor could be included.
3. Display could be IPS instead of TFT.",4
"Can't connect phone's Hotspot with this on 2.4 ghz band and service center refused to replace
And spen tip is also problematic",1
"Tablets is fine, but the SPen tip was bent and defected looks like it will break if i use it, i already made a request for inspection and will soon get it replaced as soon as the technician gives a go ahead.",4
Excellent......But refresh rate should be more....the stylus pen given along with the tab is a trap.....I have kept it aside and use it only for my professional classes .if Ur addicted to it...u might as well as not get a replacement and need to shell out lot's of money,4
"Its a nice tablet for students and note taking person. Also for entertainment person like watching videos and music. Not for Gaming.

Its lags when browsing heavy webpages.",5
"Product is good for moderate usage, work seamlessly.
Screen and build quality ia good, battery life is also fine, we can use for 1 day with moderate usage.
I feel it is bit costly at this price, it should be below 30k. Samsung should provide few spen tips with package along with 15w fast charger.
Delivery via amazon was awesome.",5
"Good producer but the
SPEN broke after
I month of usage
Had to buy additional tips that are 3rd party and cost 1000 Rs extra
will check if new tips work since it's not yet delivered
Good tablet otherwise LI support for HD playback
(Expandable memory so added 128GB SD card )",1
"One of the best in this range,
Screen quality is very good.
Performance is also good, not that smooth or fast, but decent enough to work with 2-3 application simultaneously,
Not much heating issue,
Yes I have problem with its touch. Not smooth. Sometimes. Few part of screen does not work on soft touch.
Pen is fantastic, the s pen apps are fabulous, works very well, and tonns of feature.
Lookes very expensive,",4
"Stylish looking tablet, awesome stylus, software working smooth. Some unwanted software being peddled with the equipment. Company could have given the original cover too for the total price charged.",5
"I preordered this and yes it was worthy. It's a best thing Samsung providing probably in a negligible amount. I have put pictures of playing games but I swear *I am enjoying my lectures better.*
Battery is good and friends go for it if you are searching for a device to have your lectures during lockdown.",5
"Received a Tablet with a dead Pixel... I have called the Amazon customer care, they have assigned a tech, let's c their response...... Really dissatisfied with the product... I could have put some extra money and gone for the basic laptop",1
"Received a damaged SPen. Amazon is going to send a technician for verification of the issue. Will be updating the review.

Update : The technician verified the issue and said I would be getting a replacement. After chatting with Amazon customer care executive they initiated a replacement.

I received the replacement product today and to my surprise the replacement product has the same issue. The SPen nib is frayed. Once again requested for a technician to verify the issue but this time I want a refund and not a replacement.",3
"Pros - cost-effective, in the box spen, user interface, sound quality, Samsung notes - best in the android for all the academic works, ram management, build and looks.

Cons - spen appears fragile(I don't have any issue still), absence of additional pentips, black shades on the display is poor(expected of a non amoled screen), charging speed is too slow with the in box charger(but supports fast charging with external charger).",5
" I am medical student in Maharashtra.
Like- this is awesome tablet I have purchase in my life. I am glad towards samsung for offering such great tablet , affordable tablet to student.
Dislike- the s pen is awesome but unfortunately I got already damaged nib. It really heart meü•∫üòñüò¢.
So it is my kind request to lovely Amazon,plz ask samsung to make available s pen nibs for samsung galaxy tab s6 lite.if you do this then it will be worth for students who want affordable tablet.plz plz plz make it available.

But no complaints about my most lovely tablet , samsung galaxy tab s6 lite.
Thank you.",5
Good product. Display is really good. Sound is also nice as compared to few other tabs I've used in the past. The Stylus is really a difference maker especially for people who designing or editing softwares. Battery backup is very good indeed.,4
"Quality product for the budget.
Meets all demands.
Speakers are amazing with good depth and dynamic range.
Screen is so good.
Spen is reason I bought this .
Battery could have been better but if you purchase a fast charger or use your fast xharger for mobile is really good",4
"Bought the product 8 months back. Has a Sim slot, but i had not used it. Was using home WiFI. When i inserted a SIM to use it. There is no SiM activation menu in settings. have done factory resetting amd tried different things. No support from Samsung call center too. DO NOT BUY!",1
"This tab is excellent, i am not a gamer so can‚Äôt review the performance from that perspective but everything from apps to movies work as expected. Screen size is great and the battery life can s easily 2 days for me.",5
"I've been using the tab for a month now! Honestly its made for me I guess.
My purpose was studying and watching video lectures. Life has become cool and easy with this tab.

My usage:

1. One note - extensive usage for notes taking... spen of this tab is my best buddy! It's doing an awesome job! Its a boon!
2. Video classes - laptop is not of much use for me and phone screen size has been a limitation. After this tab arrival, video classes are turning better to watch. Hassle-free experience!

I don't have any cons with this tab!

FOR STUDENTS ITS THE BEST TAB TO BUY!

HAPPY USER!",5
"Though the tablet is good and met my expectations, the s pen has its tip worn off which is highly disappointing.Contacted amazon but was informed that they could only arrange an inspection of the product as if now. Anyone with similar issues? How to sort this out? How can I get a replacement for the s pen?",3
"Likes : spen, it's functionality, tabs screen, sound, performance for games, reading , learning etc, we have 3.5mm jack which is missing in latest models, expandable storage upto 1TB.

Dislikes: spen extra nibs are not provided, fast charger not provided by the company.",4
"Gaming:- As u can play games in medium setting graphic at high graphics u can see some frame drop and lag.

Battery life:- battery life is very good as it has huge 7040mah battery and it support fast charging but in the box u will not get the fast charger.

Camera:- camera quality is ok. U can attend the webx meeting or any other meeting in good lighting condition.
Dont expect this tab for photography and videography.",4
This is a very good tab for its price. Though the screen is a TFT panel display it is as hood as my Ips LCD display phone. Battery is enough to use one day for streaming and editing or online classes etc. The spen is good enough. It doesn't cost u another 10k for a stylus. The in hand feel of the tab is very premium. So unless you want to do gaming for long times at high graphis this is best. U can play games tho smoothly.,5
The packing of the tab is very cheap and it doesn't look like even branded packing. The front and rear camera quality is really bad. Overall it's too much price for such quakity... Better go for apple at the same price range for better quality display and camera...,2
Charging cable is too short. Charging time is long. It is a TFT screen thus viewing angle is very limited. What I heard about Pen lagging seems correct. If you draw a line there is a lag and line is left many pixels. Not recommended for serious graphic s design. Pen is very light and looks good.,4
"I switched on the tab and it's just showing blued screen and nothing else.
Not even getting switched off.",1
"Display is pretty good in the LCD range
The s pen feels good to hold but non availability of replaceable nibs is a small issue
The lowest display brightness is too high, not very comfortable for viewing in indoors
A little latency during Spen writing is noticable.
Pretty good tab for media consumption and a little note taking.
Not recommendable for heavy users as the processor seems little sluggish.
Battery is a main boost for this tablet, can cope up easily in terms of regular use for 2-3 days",4
You can download only three apps at a time from playstore. That is the only limitation I have encountered. The stylus is really smooth. Device not used for gaming. Editing PDFs with stylus is very useful. For mid range users it is a great buy.,5
" Screen broken, less than a month.
Simple games lag,
Good battery life.",1
Recieved defective product. Got it refunded and had to cancel buds plus offer . Tablet went out of stock and offer period over . Can no longer get that buds plus offer . Amazon really messed up.,1
"A very nice product.,with a nice display and its size.The Spen is a steal for the price..The only downside is with the processor and the camera and the build quality is amazing..If it came with a good processor it would be the best in the range defeating the ipad 2020",4
"Really awesome tab!

Have been using it for 40 days and the best part is its s pen and how seamlessly it works with the tab, the air touch , quick functions button and the pen's tip itself.

Battery is very good, you can easily use it for 1 complete day with rigourous usage and two days easily with light usage.",5
"Ideal for medical students .. to watch online videos , solve mcqs,make notes , not as expensive as the ones with stylus in the market. Suffices for all the needs of reading and studying . Thumbs up for being useful and being pocket friendly",5
Samung is Samsung... it's a 5 star for all fields. Just a little draw back... stylus pen doesn't have extra nibs... so writing and drawing can be done on heavy duty basis.,5
"Poor battery backup. Not sure if any update patch will handle it.

It takes 2-3 hours to full charge and drains in 5-6 hours of zoom call. This is disappointing esp as I bought it for my kids' online classes.

Screen quality is very good, as expected from Samsung. Camera and Audio are also good.",3
"I received the product but didn't open the box, i opened it after 20 days as i was travelling. The screen is having vertical patch.. i could not return back as i missed return window..even samsung is not doing anything

Very poor service and response.",1
"All I can say is that the tablet packs enough features to give you the bang for the buck! The processor has adequate power, RAM Management is good, fantastic for media consumption, looks stunning, and its S Pen is an added advantage. Best tablet under 30K range.",5
"descent device for students who are taking online classes.
i m very disappointed with face unlock it not work properly in dim light üò°
battery life id good but could be better if they provided fast charging support and fast charger as well
pubg run smooth on medium settings
overall it is a cost effective product go for it.",5
Bought it for studying as its impossible to carry a laptop around...good for the price!! Spen works great.. Dont apply glossy screen guard.... If you want to write and edit pdf and all always go for matte screenguard,4
"Pros:
1. Equal Bezels, fab screen.
2. Awesome sound quality
3. No lag in performance
4. S pen free with the tab! Almost feels like writing on paper
5. Great battery life
6. Premium look. Aluminum back.
Cons:
1. AMOLED screen would have been better
2. Fast charger could have been included in the box",5
Got my Samsung galaxy tab s6 lite today. The nib of the s pen is frayed on one side. Looks like a used one. But I didn't order refurbished one. It is not convenient to draw or take notes. Highly DISAPPOINTED*. It's just a gimmick. Please do not fall for it. üò°,3
"The display is quite punchy and crisp ! The Overall performance is very much upto the mark just as expected ! Especially the most magnificent highlight of the tab S6 lite is that it comes with a S pen out of the box ! The S pen is really awesome , excellent for note taking !
The only issue sometimes occurs with a network problem that is sometimes the wifi gets disconnected ! But that can be fixed. Otherwise everything is just prolific.

Overall The Galaxy Tab S6 lite is worth every penny ! ‚ù§Ô∏èüî•",5
"Best tablet in this budget
Works smoothly.
Screen is overall nice . Margins are very thin which gives it a very stylish look
Performance is best.
No lagging
Best thing is S- pen in the box which works best in its segment.
Battery life is quite good.",5
"Writing this review after 4 months of use.
It's the cheapest android tab available with s pen. Battery life is superb... Takes time to charge but holds for 2 days. Samsung notes app is also very good, easy to take notes, u can also import pdf to the app and write on it. Spen works great. Dolby Atmos sound effects are awesome to watch videos. Only defect is, it works slow when many apps are in background otherwise there is no major problems",4
"At this price range, no tablets offer pen support like this one. Although it can never surpass the quality of an ipad. Functionality is enough for students to study.",4
"It's really ridiculous. I bought this product for more than a month. The person who gave it and received it said there was a problem in about two weeks, and the service center hasn't been able to fix it for three weeks.
I‚Äôm really angry. How did the Samsung service level be?‚Ä¶",1
"Received Yesterday, the tablet is surely amazing.Having TFT LCD screen doesn't really affect your watching experience,it looks absolutely good. Voice quality is excellent. Battery life is decent. Charging takes time as it's a normal charger. S pen is working absolutely fine. Though S pen is kind of fragile,you need to be bit careful with that. Handle it with utmost care as samsung neither provide S pen separately nor it has tip replacement option. Till now I am really liking it.",4
"S pen is good.
No lag
Good handwriting recognition
Samsung own apps are awesome
But after weeks using the s pen tip all frayed up and Amazon saying call samsung customer care and samsung saying vica versa.
I have changed my rating for these problems, however rest is fyn",3
Unable to avail pre book offer,1
"Very nice tab.
Everything is awsum.Its battery,interface,screen,colors,performance,etc.No lag at all.
Screen quality is also gud and battery also lasts for a day.

S-pen is too gud.You feel like you are writing on your notebook.
But i think s-pen tip will wear off soon,because it is very soft.Lets see how long will it continue to work.But the gud thing is that its tip is replaceable.",5
My grandson is very happy using this for his online classes,5
"Good tab for teachers and for executives.Not suitable for gaming
S pen is excellent",5
The tip of the s pen is a little worn off.,3
"I got the product on 8th June and the touch stopped functioning from 16 th June‚Ä¶ Now I have to go after the service to get the brand new item to function again. So bad from a company like Samsung , and the seller please make a note of this‚Ä¶",1
"As always samsung has one of the best display. Watching movies or reading content on the device is nice.
Spen support adds on to the experience and can be used for quick note taking.

Tablet ks light weight and easy to varey around.",4
The finger touch of this tab is not very good and i just bought this 2months ago and the tab has started to hang sometimes. Battery life is also fine like it takes 2 hours to charge and then after using for 2 3 hrs you will have to charge it again. Rest features are good,3
"The spen makes it just wonderful considering the cheaper price. Great for art, taking notes and yeah maybe for gaming as well.",5
Just what we were looking for. We use it mostly for my sons online classes. But it also has good response for note taking with onenote etc. Worth it in my opinion.,5
Excellent quality. Only 1 problem..the charger cord should be longer. ALSO the Tab does not find 5 Ghz wifi...stick to 2.5. The battery drain overnight is too much...from 90 it may go down to 40.,4
I bought this product for the only reason of study purpose and it matches all my requirements through S Pen. Amazing experience till now,5
"Battery life is not that great!
Rest of the things are way above expectations!!
Overall amazing experience after 6 months of usage
Amazing product for students and especially for note making and editing! Kudos to s-pen",5
"It is an excellent tab, worth considering it. I'm happy with my long awaited decision of buying it, after reading number of critical and negative reviews about the product. I'm happy for taking a decision of buying it, and I think it is an excellent tab, which I would recommend.",5
"I am totally loving the tab. It's a very good option in the price range especially bcoz it comes with an S-pen. seems sturdy as it has a metallic body, nib of the pen seems little fragile though. Display is bright even on minimum brightness level.

The pre-booking offer totally works. Just wait for 1-2 days for your SR.no. to get updated with Samsung.",4
"everything is great for this price...
cons-the display is good as a ipad which is available at this price
,the speaker is making some bad sounds at full volumes",3
"Honest review after 2 months use.
It's a very good tab with a really good stylus. Screen quality, touch, sound quality and processor are superb, no lagging, but only problem I experienced is with battery. Although battery drains slowly while using but overnight battery drains approx 20% without any usage and full charging takes 3-4 hrs (should've given a fast charger). Still u can get 2 days battery backup upon full charging with 5-6 hrs screen time/day.",5
Screen quality is bad. The screen bleed at the edges.,3
"Have been using it for 6 months now and I love using it. However, it has a horrible battery life during standby.

The battery life is good when you're using the tablet. But when it is in standby, the battery reduces by 40-50% in one night.",2
Well then got it for sketch and watching OTT. Doing a job for now and loookg forward to use more. Even the kindle reading experience is really good. Best value for money with the processor speed.,5
Initially I liked the tab but after weeks of use I feel its crap. Most apps are not compatible with the tab and either hang or if using the split screen they will just crash. Never buying any android device again.,2
"Camera of this Tab is not good at all , for those want to have good vedio quality exam and all , it is better to take Laptop. Rest up to now is good
Now today after just buying after 20 days it got hanged and not able to start I don't know what to do ..finally I need to call customer care",2
"Being a fan of Samsung I am very happy with my purchase.
Metal body
Slim design
A pen
Above are the special features of it & good pixel clarity makes u realize an amazing visual experience.
Only the issue is it's A pen tip: all A pens in the sale are with broken nib, if you read the reviews you will find the complaint repeatedly",5
"I got a damaged product. When I open the box i saw S pen's tip is frayed. I bought this product because of S pen. And i received it damages. Even the box looks old.
Please replace my product as soon as possible.",1
"This was my first experience buying an electronic item on Amazon.in . I will say, I wasn't disappointed. The product was delivered as described in the product description.
One thing I would like to add is, the charger is not a fast charger. So it takes a long time( about 2 hours) to fully charge the tablet. W.r.t seller, the package was delivered on time and fully intact.",5
"As it can be seen in the other comments, I am also unable to redeem prebook offer. It is show6thhe serial is ineligible for prebook offer. No help from samsung.",1
Initially i found it was good .Recently i found from past few days the tab is suddenly gets locked like a flash n the lockscreen appears after that sometimes it gets unlocked and fine but sometime it gets stuck n gives trouble n doesnot unlock.so i have checked all settings every thing fine so am feeling that may be its a faulty one,3
Tablet was powered on in open box. Seal was broken cello tape was applied m returned the product. How this thing we can expect from Amazon,2
"Spen- Spen tip is frayed. And no other nibs are provided on box.i purchasd this tab due to spen features but i am bit worried now and in market also it is very difucult to find the nibs.

Overall tab is top notch quality not an issue. Samsung should provide spen nibs easily to the customer",4
Samsung galaxy tab s6 lite is an amazing tablet. Battery backup is great. S pen is very responsive. Samsung has made to make notes much easier with the use of s pen. Screen size of 10.4 inch makes it very comfortable to read e books. Screen quality is also good but don't compare it with amoled display of other Samsung flagship device.,5
"Prebook offer says Download Samsung Shop from Playstore.
The Samsung Shop is not visible in playstore.

So unable to redeem.",1
I like everything about it! I dislike nothing in it!! Luckily got my hands on the last piece of the rose gold tab that i tried getting everywhere else in vain. So thank you Amazon.in & thanks for the super prompt delivery!!,5
"This Product from Samsung has met my expectations. Gift vouchers and credit card instant discount during prime day made this product Value For Money to me. Really excited to use the product.
Quick feedback of product is -
-Overall premium feel
-screen size, Colors found to be just perfect
-sounds are good
-S Pen tip is not rugged and susceptible to wear.
-Found Bit laggy",5
"I bought it for learning digital drawing, and this is serving my purpose.
I'm satisfied with this.",4
"This product is good for students
Good battery life but slow charging due to inbox charger
Good for online studies in as this is only u can affordable range from samsung other products are above 50k‚Çπ
Sound is fine on speaker,but better with earphones
I will not recommend for online gaming as it uses exynos processor and sometimes see lag in gaming.
Brightness is fine as it does not have super amoled display of samsung.",3
Spen was damaged . Asked appario retail for a replacement . But the replacement did not even have the spen and the replacement tab looked used and the packaging was loose. Lost faith in the seller and in Amazon. Will never purchase high value goods,1
"It's above all the best in performance ,but to hold this unit is bit heavy with cover and without cover is difficult.10.1 inch is far better to handle could not get same configure in 10 inch hence bought this.its tedious to hold this pc its as good as table model.",5
"This tablet is a little bit expensive, but still don‚Äôt support dex mode. And if you want to use free MS OFFICE, this tablet doesn‚Äôt support MS Office free",1
"The device is good, i liked it.
SPen also works flawlessly, even working properly after placing tempered glass on the screen.",5
Perfect for the school student. Android 10 with even competitive apps make it more affordable than the iPad. The Lite version is a great entry to the tablet space and is very convenient and easy to carry.,5
"Got a faulty pen. Disappointed with the Amazon service, cause for replacement it will take 45days. Even though am a prime member. Pathetic it is.",2
"Pros
Built quality.
Screen quality and display.
Speed.

Cons
Battery is gone by August 2021, I bought it in October 2020
No screen protector. Need to buy extra.
No protective cover.",3
"Screen quality is good. Battery life, I got the product yesterday only hence I am unable to provide any information on battery life and I am not using it for gaming.",5
Very sleek but a bit on heavier side. Holding in hand for long time is not going to be easy. Very good audio. Display is decent. Not amoled so it cannot be compared to new gen samsung phones. Battery is decent. Stylus is very useful.,5
"It was told you can buy Samsung buds or book cover if you pre book it. I had and received it, now i was told to go to this offer you have to install samsung shop app which is not compatible with this tablet
Cheating",3
I have been using it for a week now..well if u want a tablet for studies ..movies ott and all..then it is a must buy...for light gaming it is ok..like 1 hr a day..but if u want full performance then go for ipad(only gaming performance would be better) every other thing is better in this one..and the spen adds to it's compatibility.,4
"Got the colour of my choice.. Chiffon pink... S pen is working good... Able to read, write and watch videos nicely.. Very appropriate for a student of any professional.. Amazing tablet with reasonable price. üòç",5
It is a Budget tablet and the functions provided are certainly Value for Money. It doesn't support Samsung Dex is a negative for me,5
"It's a good product from samsung. no lag, battery was good, Note making made easy, good for multi tasking, spen works well, overall I was satisfied with the purchase",5
"Best tab under 30k.
Display- 10/10
Sound quality- 9/10
Build quality- 9/10
Camera- 6/10 ( better compared to other tabs in this range)
S6 pen stylus- 9/10
Overall performace- 9/10

I am really satisfied with this and it does it's job perfectly what it claims.",5
"Best slim tablet. Its portable and has a good display, but would have loved more to see an amoled display on it. Coupled with the pre-booking offer of buds/cover, it's a steal.",5
"Didn't find much use of S pen. Glad I chose 4GB RAM, it's fast. Battery seems to drain faster than expected :(

Better than worthless Lenovo. Guys believe me, do not go for Lenovo even though it may be a little cheaper.

I am glad I made this purchase.",4
I like it very much! Its functioning if good. I dont recomend its for gaming though games like among us work but sometimes it lags. Even though most of the reviews that say the tip of the s pen is bent I risked and ordered but my s pen is completely fine. I am happy for that. I like the colour too...I am satisfied but it would better if the processor was more efficient.,5
Just received my tab yesterday... super speakers good display... s pen is also good.. I buyed for studying and notes making... and its perfect for it... I can't say much about the gaming part,5
Worth the wait....Initial usage is going above and beyond expectations. Need few more days to check all aspects.,5
"Good tablet, at this price... just go for it, without any hesitation...
S pen is good...
Moderate gaming can be done easily, with occasional big games, multitasking not an issue, android experience is good, bigger and brilliant display...
Everything is fine...",5
Bad experience screen broken as well as spen broken just go for ipad because of higher performance and longer software updates. If you dont want spen just go for ipad,5
"Very good tab at this price range although storage can be improved. The packing was pathetic, they were dents on all corners. Luckily the tab and the pen side are in good condition.

Apt for students and working professionals. Not for heavy gaming",3
"Good tablet, but if you can stretch for 5k more then go with iPad 8 gen. Ipad is better than android tablet. Performance is way better in iPad. Buy it over 0 interest email and for 9 months it is just 400-500 over the S6 lite. Go with iPad 8th gen.",3
good tablet for day to day usage and good display. But a very slow charging battery.,4
"The product serves the purpose. It is value for Money.

Not a hardcore gaming device but it never let you down while you play economical games. Screen is perfect and i would rate it best for daily use with a premium feel.",5
"It's good , battery could be better and don't support to USB pen drives or USB keyboards ,
Have to buy seprate small compatible blutooth keyboard and mouse",4
"Receiver the product on time and in perfect condition. The tab is good for daily usage. Good sound quality for movies/songs/web-series.

The battery life is about 2-3 days depending upon the usage. Screen quality is good too! The only con is that the fast charging is not included.

S pen is included in the box.",5
"1) Ultimately slim but tough build quality.
2) Highly recommend for artist who do quick scribbling, sketching and concept designs.
3) Battery life is amazing.
4) S pen is accurate.
5) last but not list Sound quality is just mind blowing.",4
"Haven't even used the tab for a year and started having screen burn issues.

Samsung service is refusing to help even under warranty, absolute waste of money.",1
"I got lot of error messages when I tried to install Samsung Shop in the tab. Without this app, you can't avail the offer.
Some sample error messages:
1. This app not available in your country. So, I change my Google Id and try again.
2. Now, its telling, this app is not optimised for your device.
Then, why are you asking us to go to this app?",3
"Very good tab with confluence of price, performance and features
1. Performance is very good
2. Display is very good
3. Audio very good
4. Software ( android 10)/ UI very good
5. Battery life is good
6. Camera satisfactory

Also excellent on time delivery by Amazon",5
"Very nice tab, no lagging, worth penny, Audio quality is fabulous to watch movies and audio. Calls can be made.",5
S6 lite tablet was received in good condition but as usual stylus s pen tip in blunt condition. Requested amazon for replacement which they are yet to do/confirm.,3
"Spen quality is not good , too fragile!.
Tab Heats up abruptly when brightness is full.
Face recon is slow.
Poor quality checks by Samsung.
Finally returned it.",1
"Battery life : I say its damn good. Battery last for a long duration
Screen: I find just a little difference when compared to amoled display in my galaxy m31
Sound system: Its a wonderful I would say because of speakers on either side gave us to experience loud and better stereotype sound
Stylus : I found the tip is not Good.
It's a good value for what u spend",4
I bought this for reading and watching videos and it works really well in this aspect. Much lower priced than Samsung Galaxy S6 Tab or S5e Tab. Totally worth the money. S-Pen too works very well. Display is good thought it does not have AMOLED. Haven't had any problems with display or function of the tab. Bought it when it was launched and it's working fine since then.,5
Works well,5
"This is a perfect tablet for watching media, readings. The speaker output is good. The interface is fast. The battery life is decent. A very well rounded device.",4
"Yes, this is a perfect one .... No issues with the tablet at all... The only thing that was not acceptable was the packaging , they had just wrapped one/2 very thin transperant cover over the tablet box ..... Small items are packed very well by Amazon , but such expensive ones had to be packed well.....",4
"It takes a lot of time to charge the unit. Samsung should really work on the fast charging bit.
Disappointed.",1
"Tablet is super good and very responsive, but the S-Pen I received was frayed. I asked for a replacement but Amazon initiated a service visit to validated the issue.",4
"Frayed S-pen tip, how do I get a replacement nib?

The tab is great though !!",2
"Screen has some dead pixels other than that tablet is good , raised a replacement for that and waiting for tech visit , will update after the visit of technician .",3
"Too heavy to hold for a long time. Slow processor. Lack of fingerprint sensor is bad for login. Sound and picture quality is good. Battery life is poor. Overall, not a satisfying experience.",4
"Love the product.worth the pre book
Spectacular built and great display amazing sound
S pen is fabulous",5
I must say its a great deal came in good packing and perfect as expected,5
"Good tablet , Speaker are best .
S pen very good. Just If extra spen tips/nibs given then it would be very nice. Since They are not available for sale also.
Amazon service is fast as always.",4
I purchased this as a gift to my 9 year old niece and I am happy to say that she is loving it.The S-pen included in the box adds even more value to the overall amazing experience this tab delivers. I would highly recommend it especially when everything is going online. Its budget friendly yet fantastic buy!,5
"Audio and battery are not so sufficient, they could be enhanced upon. MS office also require subscription(‚Çπ365) plan. Rest ok, specially S-pen is excellent. Charger/data cable length is too short.",3
"Processor, touch sensitivity & note writing, battery backup, material used, design -satisfactory (4.5 out of 5).
After1month(aprox.) of use, I can say now that it is very good deal to have the product in this price range(28k). Thank you Samsung and Amazon.",4
"After usage of few days I found it easy to use. However, after lot of efforts I could of use the pre book offer (very long lead time for delivery of cover with no status update)
Also, tip of S pen looks to be worn out since opening the Tab. Although it's working fine.",3
"Superb product with a good battery life and the s pen is awesome. Best for taking notes, reading e books and watching the occasional prime video",5
Best tablet for multipurpose. Give display. Permission finish. All over best deal in 31k.,5
"I wanted a tab for mainly artwork and watching online stuff...This is the best for it's price and performance!!
awesome buy at a great price during Amazon festival!! Inclusive pen makes it the best in its segment",5
"It is a quality tab from Samsung for common people...
S pen works perfect and smooth..best for teaching..
Very good battery life...fully satisfied...
And at last...the delivery was superfast....thanks",5
"I ordered and replaced it twice, S pen was damaged and then next time the screen was heating up, don't buy it",1
"I got this tab in 23k with HDFC card offer.
Screen quality is average
Audio is good
Main highlight is s-pen which is pretty awesome e
Better to avoid for gaming",5
It has got good sound quality and screen quality is also good. The S pen is a delight to draw. The performance is fast enough for your work and entertainment purposes. Battery backup is also good.,5
Great for student and casual low graphic gaming. But a the S pen makes it worth buying.,4
best budget tablet for student. TFT display is really good. support 4k videos. processor is decent not a flagship one but really good for daily normal usage. storage 64gb.,4
Everything feels premium about this device. But the Spen that came with this device had a chipped nib (it‚Äôs still working though). I wish replacement nibs were provided in the box like the tab s4 & tab s6.,4
Perfect Tab for WFH and online classes.. battery charging takes 4 hrs.. Apart from that best Tab in this price range. highly recommended..,5
"The Product that I received was in damaged condition.. The Tip of S pen was completely damaged.
This was not expected from Amazon",3
"Tab is great, I'm a bit concerned about the quality of the s pen though. I think it's a lot rougher than it should be and might possibly damage the screen. I'll be looking for alternative stylus options.",4
Loving it excellent sound screen quality is excellent viewing angles also good haven't done much gaming spen works as charm overall excellent product from Samsung.,5
Absolutely value for money. Don'texpect your phone like experience but good enoughfor a tab. Meets my daily needs to my expectations. Recommended,5
"Look 4‚Ä¢8/5
Battery 4‚Ä¢3/5
Camera 3.8/5
Display 4.5/5
Sound 4.5/5
Priceing 4.5/5
Overall 4.5/5",4
"except processor everything is good, but it could have better . Moderate gaming works well . Charging is slow with boxxed charger",4
"Everything seems fine, but samsung attached only 1.55 A chrger with it. Ut takes more than 5 hours to charge to battery fully.",4
You can use it as your mini laptop. Played call of duty with no lags. Screen is not an amoled but still it is a delightful experience to view movies on this audio quality is amazing too,5
"I am a very careful user(following best practices), even though, In 4months of time the top right corner was heating up, I contacted the service centre they mentioned motherboard and display issue. I guess they are using cheap quality hardware.",1
"After lot of research selected this product and it's been over a month and it has proved to be good enough.
Does it's job perfectly.
Good quality material.
Happy with the purchase.",5
battery life is good and using for online classes for kids . So far its running smooth no issues.,5
"Good product, works perfectly fine. If you're looking for moderate usage, this is the best tab for you! Not suitable for heavy gaming. Suitable for amything apart from gaming. I use it for videos and reading pdfs and notes. Display is good and battery life is 10hrs+",5
Very happy with this purchase.The battery life is good and the pen is amazing it glides smoothly making taking notes a whole lot of fun.,4
"I liked the display (absolutely marvelous display)
But the S pen is damaged a little and is not up to the quality it was supposed to have.",4
"I have received brand new tab s6 lite it is very impressive...
But in the same box I received band spen or say broken... it's very disappointing for me ...
For tab I'll give 5‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ üëç and for s-pen üëéüëéüëé",4
"Best tab out there, but it comes with zero extra tips/nibs for the spen. And once it wears out you're out of luck. Original ones are not available in service centres, nor you could buy original ones online . Enjoy third party ones (which are usually for note 8/9 and will feel different than original)",5
"Don't buy this tab, if wanna buy android then go for samsung tan under 15000.00, and if you are looking for note taking tab then go for ipad.",1
Tablet is awesome but the Spen looses color after sometime and the Pen Nib starts to make marks on the screen after some time which I am encountering currently.,3
I this a good tab at this price range. I brought this for my kid who is using this for their online classes. its been couple of months and this seems to be really good.,5
"need more powerful in terms of screen or touch, the durability of the battery, charging time too long but display is good while watching movies or series.",2
"This is not good tab for games or high end apps. Its only entry level tab. Performance is very bad, it's Damm slow and goes non responsive mode.",1
The charger and cable stopped working after 5 months,1
"Writing the review after 18 days of usage.
Audio via headphone jack is not as good as it should be considering Dolby Atmos.
Received a slightly damaged spen tip. But works good. The pen tip feels very fragile. Should consider bundling a better one or provide nib replacement.",4
"At this price range... what more to ask.
Battery life is good, gaming is ok.
samsung pen is fantastic for notes and drawing.
currently experimenting with heavy drawing and music editing apps and this tablet is holding good.
if you are a student like me then go for it.",4
WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity not really stable looks like require some updates. It even doesn't work nicely with Samsung Buds plus. It is good but not really value for money. Can opt for other model.,3
A very good tablet with absolute sound quality. Mainly used for watching movies and office work. So far very good,5
The tablet is wonderful. However the charger has a problem and I hope that Amazon will let me know how I can get a fresh charger and cable. The ordering process and delivery was super smooth as always.,3
"Everything is good except for gaming... Those who wish to play heavy gaming, please don't buy this. But, if you are a fan of drawing or writing, then, this tablet is recommended. Out of all the features, S-pen is the best one and works perfectly without any issues or so whatever...",4
"Dnt buy from Amazon, s pen comes demaged",1
"Paying this much price and the response from the tablet is just worst.
Not for gaming.
Very slow in installing apps.
Camera is very old (just like 2016 camera)
Just don't buy it if you are using for gaming or extensive use.",3
SHOCKING TO KNOW FROM AMAZON CUSTOMER CARE THAT ELECTRONIC ITEMS ARE NOT RETURNABLE AND ANY WHERE IT IS NOT MENTION.TO ALL PURCHASER MY SUGGESTION DO NOT BUY FROM AMAZON.,1
At this price other options are better yes it is very bad screen quality is very poor,1
"Premium version of budget tab. Awesome experience with spen. Very good move by samsung.
Totally worth the money",4
"We received Samsung Galaxy S6 Lite LTE model with no physical damage and pre-date TAB delivered! After one week usage there is no problem! This model very comfortable for study purpose.Really very happy using this Samsung Galaxy S6 Lite (LTE)Tab. Good model very simple and stylish S Pen (Gray Color).

Thanks Amazon !!!",5
It a very good product. But why don't they provide a fast charger brick in the box. While the tab supports fast charging. A normal charging cable with a normal brick is given. Is this how it comes from the company???,4
Excellent product,5
Kind of fills the void of a good tablet on android platform. Performs the day to day tasks like a breeze. Only glitch I noticed was with face unlock...ain't that accurate and reliable and fast. Redemption offer worked for me and I have ordered a book cover. Having said all this I'd like to mention that iOS is still iOS.,4
simply superb .used for 3 months or more so far and it gave no reason to complaint .Only preinstalled apps eat up the memory,5
Display quality is not so good. Sound is amazing. For gaming you will not be disappointed. Performance is also quite good. Battery backup is amazing. S pen is a gift. Ram management is nice. Lack of internal storage. As copare to specs price is lil bit higher.,5
"Screen quality is kinda down but I think it's still good for the price, but it's been a week and the tab is showing a problem, the display closes on its own while I set the lock screen time after 2min inactivity. Sometimes it gets hard to wake it up.",3
"Good product screen quality, battery life and gaming expeince is good. Best is the parental controll which is very helpfull",4
Have been using it for last 45 days. It is too good.. would recommend it over entry level ipad...,5
"Primary use for kindle and notes for online classes, the s pen works as intended. Definitely go for it. Not recommended for gaming.",5
"There is a dead pixel near the bottom side which I noticed after the return period. Also, the included Spen's nib was slightly kinked. Can not find any replacement nib online! Samsung Service Centre refused to provide nibs! inspect your product upon arrival",3
"I have installed kindle app and guess what, I'm in love with this device. Works well if all you need is YouTube, Prime, Game and Kindle",5
"I'm using the tab for last 8,9 months and playing pubg but it didn't get any issue and run very smoothly",5
This is an excellent product from Samsung. Wow performance and build quality. Samsung has always been my favorite brand.,5
"The quality of the pen of the tablet is not upto the mark. The tip of the pen has worn out on the use itself. Hence, I request that the pen may please be replaced immediately without any cost.",5
"Very good tab
Long lasting battery
Better screen
But sometimes while writing with stylus there is a lag
Features are very good
You need to subscribe MS office to use PPT",4
Tablet is great. It is useful for daily use. One thing I would like to tell that I didn't receive fast charger. They should provide it.,4
Excellent Tab. Got the 4G one. Good companion for travel. I use it for Mails and eBooks. perfect in all ways.,5
Writing after 10 days of usage. Excellent tab at this price and pen stylus is excellent,5
"It's a very good tab for students and spen is too great highly
Screen- it's a TFT display but superb i cant defferenciat between this screen and my amoled smart phone

Gaming- it's not a gaming tab but u can some heavy games

Ui - it's great too clean ui

Spen - it's is very nice",5
Battery life is amazing and for study purposes it is a very useful gadget in budget...i dont play games that much so i cant tell you about gaming but overall nice experience with tab s6 lite,5
"I really like it this product..i love it, but it cannot insert sim. Anyway thanks to amazon and samsung company.",5
It's a great buy for my online Classes. The pen is such a great option for the price you pay.,5
If you have budget problem then definately go for this. For reading purpose its a good option. I dont have any experience of gaming. So i think you can buy it without any hesitation for studying purpose.,5
Nice product. Happy to have it.,5
"Very good tablet for this price range. Only one con I noticed, the nib of the s pen provided is very delicate and may get damaged easily. They should have provided replacement nibs. Overall good purchase",4
Atleast product quality should be screened before you dispatch the item.. the screen was internally damaged from the beginning as said by the Amazon inspection person.. very bad experience,1
"I got a used product, the pen nib was damaged and the box was already opened and was taped from outside.",1
"I'm totally loving it. Worth very penny. Only downside is the camera part. I don't know why everybody have problem with Spen, mine works fine and is as perfect as it was when I unboxed it. You can see the photos attached. Those arts are done in Samsung galaxy tab S6 lite.",4
"Light Weight,good screen but battery life is poor for binge watching,works better on wifi as compared to lite.",4
"very slim and speed, and useful for my office purpose too",5
If anyone is buying for note making then please don't the quality of spen's nip is very poor after one month of decent use my spen's nip was about to finish and even worse not been able to find extra comparable nibs please don't buy this tablet for student use.,2
"I have pre-ordered the Samsung Tab S6 lite on Jun 11th, delivered on 22nd Jun. Tab is good, fast, audio (Dolby Atmos) is awesome.

Got the (with tab purchase) discount coupon code for Galaxy Buds+ after tab activation and order for the same.

This tab is good for students as it comes with S pen it makes note carrying easy if you are student and have a budget of 26k u can go for it.. But if u want tablet for gaming then I would suggest iPad as games are most optimized in ios based devices.,4
Good for Money.,5
Good for study purposes.,4
It is a worthy product and especially for a medical student who use prepladder and marrow app for preparation. Both apps work fine in this tab.,5

Looks good. Video quality is awsum. Lovd it. Though AMOLED display is missing still video quality is much better. Pens also works perfectly. Camera is not so good( we can't get good range cameras in this price range). Tablets are not designed for photography. Still camera is okay. Very smooth.,5

"Resolution could have been better
Battery backup seems decent

Excellent product . The tab is sleek and slim. Fast enough . Not an amoled screen but you would not see a difference until you keep an amoled screen side by side. Notes taking was never better. Buy the tab . I am 15 year old and am using it for studies. The best.,5
Packaging was not so great.. overall performance was good ...nice display...spen was great..good to create notes..,4

"Reallly good so far ...... . Love it ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§... Iam little worried about s pen tip, ..... Hope samsung provide us the replacement tips in Amazon",5
Faulty product. The touch screen has issues Even the replaced product had faulty screen,1
 If u r looking for gaming its Definitely not,4
"I use it for Emails, Painting, Drawing, Reading and for the the same this is an excellent stuff.",5
"Better to buy this product directly from a shop.

It's very nice overall but tip of the S pen is left only 25% of its actual size after jst using it for 30 mins so I rarely use S pen anymore fearing it will be completely gone . .,4
So far no complaints. Perfect for note taking. Display and battery back up super.,5
Bought this for my daughter.she‚Äôs happy using the tab.serves purpose.S pen is good as on no problem,5
After using for more than 6 mnth the device screen is getting freeze most of the tym .which is a big demerit for this tab .,4

"Item is very good but the benefits promised like free access to YouTube premium is not available. Not suitable for gaming, good for day to day business and studies activities.",2
It‚Äôs a great product to use by Children as well as for teachers.,5
The spen tip was deformed. The quality of the nib is not satisfied. Otherwise the tab is superb and has many unique features. Ordered for replacement.,2
For taking notes is perfect ..only concern is this .. how many days this pencil tip will last?,5
Perfect for multiple uses ....great product...as per standard. .,5
"When we're paying 32K for the product,you should give at least silicon cover and 5 S-pen tip points aling with it.",5

"Got this by seeing the positive reviews, but it is a total disappointment. Sound quality is very low and Bass is 0. It is totally nothing when compared to JBL CS150 SI which was awesome. Boat needs to improve its sound drivers, at this cost it is very disappointing.",2

Worst product ever in my life... Got defected within 10 days of use ... Automatic shuffling of songs.. not able to power off... please Don't purchase this product ... Highly disappointed... Paisa barbaad BC,2
"But only problem with this product is it is not long lasting i have purchased it and within 10 days it was not working, it was not getting onn after giving full charge also. Otherwise sound and bass are good in this price range.",2
"Superb Speakers, Very Nice bass and sound . well i purchased this on indian diwali festival sale for just Rs 1990 in a deal. even the bluetooth feature is really nice. actually i want to give 5 stars to the rating but giving 4 stars only because of speakers wires are really small. you need extra wires extention to mount it on all the corners of walls",4
"2nd time buy it. Bass very good
Last time cost Rs. 2400
This time Rs.3100 cost to high
But sound & bass perfect.
I use last 3 years.",5
Awesome sound quality and bass value for money..,5
"Need to understand how to save fm channels on numbers. Default volume is 45 but there must be an option to set that as well.

Someone mentioned bass is missing, but i think it has. Overall good experience.",4
Nice product.. worth for üí∞,5
"Zebronics has always been making supremely good yet affordable Products.
At such a low price it's really a nice product.
Bluetooth aux radio and various types of wired connections as well.
Strongly recommend if you're looking for a good home theater at an affordable price.
Best one I could find in this range.",5
"Haven't used the remote yet but it is perfect for a surround sound and a home theatre experience.Packaging was good delivery was fast. I felt the control knobs are bit weak but for that you have a remote. Tested bluetooth pairing also works well.Sound is good clarity is perfect.Go for it. It won't create much of disturbances to your neighbours even if ur playing in high volume.

Update : after 6 months of usage the circuit of the display is getting cut. No matter how good or cheap the product is always go for a branded one like Sony, Samsung, Philips, etc. As these won't ever dissapoint you.",5
Speaker is good and sound quality is also better in this budget. If you have small budget and want to buy home theater go for it without any doubt but only thing is that quality of product which Amazon should take care I received box which is little bit damaged and inside box two out of five speakers are damaged and also look like I received used product because it has scratches on some speakers. Overall product is good in this price range.,5
"Good product at thc print. good sound quality
easily conneced with Mobiles als. connected to
Smart Tv with Aux cables. Overall experience

" Clear sound and bass is also very good, easy to pair with Bluetooth, you can listen in my video only 80% valume it's so loud and clear, i m fully satisfied.. Seeing lots of negative review on this i thought to try this bcoz many are positive cmnts.. But believe me its worth for money",5
"Pros:
Lucrative price
Easy to connect:BT/aux/usb/FM
Remote control
Ease of setup
Cons:
Build material is not good since for the price you have to settle at a margin :P
Needs better cable management",5
"I'm writing this review after use of more than 2 years the product haven't gave any hard time so far.
Easy to install
Nice bass
The surround sound is awesome
Bt connection fm aux works perfectly fine.
Works great for home theatre.",5
Super product.sound quality is soo good. I never expected this in this price. Worth for money I was using this since 2 months.after that I was writing this review.,5
Its output power (65watt)was very powerful. Its sound quality was so standard. Its woofer sound will make you to feel the music in better way. ‚ò∫ Nice quality i had bought this item 2 years ago since no complaints happened in this product. Thank you amazon&zeebronics. ‚ò∫,5
Gifted to my Sis. I‚Äôm glad that she liked it & impressed with the Sound & Bass. At this price this is one of the great sound system. For those who are commenting that Sound & Bass is not good well you won‚Äôt be getting a Bose 5.1 at ‚Çπ3-4K. You‚Äôll need to spend 3-4Lakhs for that. So don‚Äôt expect Dolby Atmos sound at this range. And for the people looking for an sound system at budget then definitely this is for you.,5
"Purchased in Aug, 2016, writing this review in Nov, 2020.
I've been using this for more than 4 years and you can not get better speakers at this price.",5
"This is a beautiful looking speaker set with great bass. But sadly the remote is faulty. Its continuously activated without any buttons being pressed as you can see in foto but worse my return or replace time has expired so not sure what I can do about that The surround speakers are not that great. My f&d speakers are better. But over all its v nice. I ordered on 17/10, got it on 24.",4
I am writing the review after 3years of use . Its value for money and bluetooth connectivity is really really good n it's still working fine like it worked on the day one.,5
"Super sound quality...
It's good
Remote control and Bluetooth next level",5
"Build Quality - 4/5 | It's good for the price.|
Sound quality - 4/5 | I feel the bass is not really good and there is a little lack of clarity |
Connectivity - 5/5 | There is no problem in connectivity and the bluetooth feature works pretty well |
I got it for the price of INR 2799 and for this price it is really a value for money product.
RECOMMENDED!!!",4

Worth for the money,5
"When Bluetooth connectivity used only 5 subwoofers works & For AUX cable only 3 world. Subwoofers are made up of plastic material but sound quality is good.

"Alright. So, I ordered this speaker mainly because of its Bluetooth connectivity as my old Sony 4.1 lacks that particular feature and if I want to listen to some music from my phone in that speaker, I would have to physically connect it and then changing the songs when needed is a hassle. So, I was looking for a speaker at comparatively lower price that wouldn't compromise the sound quality. I usually buy speakers after at least listening to its sound in a shop, but this time I gave it a chance and trusted those many reviewers who said this is the best budget speaker with good enough sound quality and good enough bass. Well, I was kind of taken aback after seeing the actual woofer size. It was smaller than I expected and physical size does matter when it comes to bass and hence the bass is not solid enough. Now, don't misinterpret. It's a pretty thumpy bass and it doesn't cracks, but still it somehow lacks the solidity that I have heard in some other speakers. Clarity is really good, both over Aux and bluetooth. When it comes to the total loudness, it's not very loud really. Good enough for a medium sized room, but even with full volume at the speaker level and on the device, it won't blow your roof away...far from it. On the positive side, even at maximum volume the sound doesn't degrade and retains its quality. With bluetooth the sound loudness is at 90% that of what you get with Aux. The bass also goes down a bit with bluetooth. The bluetooth connectivity is awesome, instant, quality is good and doesn't have any noticeable delay(which I was worried about). As a result, I decided to use this speaker with my TV(over bluetooth) and I would keep my Sony for listening to music. By the way, the best part is the remote, it has many functions and the most usable are your ability to control sound level at each and every speaker and the woofer.

Edit : I want to add few points regarding the remote control. I found it bit hard to set up the FM channels. At first I didn't find the auto scan channel option. There is a scan button, but on pressing it, nothing happened(Later I found out from the manual you have to press it for 2-3 seconds to get it working). So, I had to manually tune and find each channel by using tune+ - buttons. And then it was really tricky to save those channels once you find it. On pressing the Save button, it always tries to save them under Channel 01, and changing the name is a bit tricky, I am sure you will figure it out. The good thing is, you can directly type in any channel frequency number from the numeric keypad on the remote. So, in FM mode if you type 938, it will take you to 93.8 FM channel. That's good. The only downside to this remote control is, it has no mute option. In the manual it says, the REPEAT button will function as Mute, but it doesn't work.",4
Such a nice product. Using it for more than 2 years. Bluetooth connectivity looks fine as well as the sound quality.,5
Nice home theter product,5
Working as expected,5
"The sound is very clear. The bass control is not available in your remote, you have to adjust it from your playback device. This home theater will be perfect for a 15'x18' room. If you are hosting a house party this gadget will defenitely increase your reputation. Better than expensive portable sound speakers. If portability is not a primary requirement, go for it.",5
Awesome product this is the major product any one wants to buy,5
"Super product. Using it since 3 years. Only the remote not working after 3 years but manageble with the subwoofer panel options.

"Product works as expected, but the bass isn't there like it was to be seen with other players. Bass comes with the song, non tunable. Make, build and quality is good. Not happy with the speakers sound though. Other reviews on YouTube and other pages suggested that this product survived for 3 plus years, if that be true then I am glad I made the right purchase.",4

"REVIEW AFTER 2 YEARS: Zebronics 5.1 Home Theatre System is the Best and great performance like Sony Systems. Sounds are very best and Good Clearance. Subwoofer Giving bass Effect very highly. No others speakers give bass at this Price Range. ‚ö†Ô∏èI have extended the wires of this speakers for my room size.
TIPS FOR BEST BASS OUTPUT:
1. Subwoofer Should Place in ""Floor Only.
2. Equalizer should change to Eq2 on system or Connect with TV with AUX cable & adjust your favourite Equalizer.
3. Reduce the volume of FR FL CE SR SL speaker's on remote to (-10).
4. Increase the Volume of SW (SubWoofer) to (+10).
5. Speakers should keep seperately to Best Theatre Feeling.",5
"I'm a big fan of Zebronics. And like always they've met my expectations, even exceeded them. Sound quality is awesome for audiophiles. Balanced output, adequate loudness and bass. Doesn't hurt the ears as a sharp piercing noise even at the highest volume level. No audible distortion. After sales service is great. Overall a highly recommended sound system.",5
"Very good product, good speaker, we can connect everything like USB, FM, SD CARD, BLUETOOTH, DVD, AUX CABLE for computer and Mobile ,,, really good and low price, every one can buy this and every one can satisfy with this product ,,, and Amazon correct time delivery , Thanks,,, now I am planning to buy this product one more",5
"First of all speaker looks very nice in black colour. And sound was good yes it was better than Phillips Heartbeat so double thumbs up üëçüëç for sound. Speaker was suitable for all kinds of room wether it was any room as well as it was also used in small restaurant and shops also. Firstly other speakers of zebronics 4.1 mm speaker but there was a difference of just 500 rupees. So i bought this and yes i'm satisfy. If Amazon had a option for video uploading then i definitely upload that video. So go for it guys it will never ever disappoint you.

There was just a problem with packaging which Amazon have to improve that there was just a double layer of plastic sheet. That's it. So it needs a improvement.",5
"Totally worth the price. Good quality product by Zebronics. They usually make good products barring a few exceptions.
The wattage is around 70 combined. Treble, bass and volume control with an equalizer. Perfect for a 200 sq feet room.
Can get rather loud, of course that is relative, so caution while hammering away at night.
Would definitely recommend this product for a price of 2999, its a steal. Bluetooth and a remote with a good 20 feet of range are great too.
Oh and did I mention theres a radio and USB device too along with the fact that it is a 5.1.
Okay I think you get the hint.",5
"A very Good product for the Price what we pay..Almost used this product for more than 6 Months
Pros:
Good build quality
Nice Midds and Bass
Good Sound for price
Bluetooth Functionality
SD card Function",5
"Product is very good as shown in the picture.
It is suitable for compact room . Don't expect too much. Surround system is as much as good. But the length of the wire should be shot. But rest of the things is good.
Pros :
Value for money (‚Çπ3000)
Compact home theatre
User friendly
FM
USB
BT
AUX, SD
All in one

Cons:
Short wire
You can satisfy the sound only if your volume is high level (60)

This is all about my purchase review. I'll update my review after use the product may me in one month.",5
"Its really good value for money product
Great quality of sound and bass
Its the best if yoy ask me in this range.
But they did not provide battery for the remote.",5
"Bass is ok and in full sound, good to hear in low volume.
Bluetooth sound is excellent, connect automatically. I'm using with my laptop.",4
"Wow. I searched for Bluetooth 4.1 an this was 1st search result a 5.1 bluetooth. I am so lucky :). Everyone this product is great from Zebronics without a doubt. You won't find better Bluetooth speakers in this range. Sound is awesome, bass is good enough. I also have 2.1 and 4.1 Bluetooth speakers of zebronics and both cannot be compared with this one.",5
Product is good . Good bass in low volume . Sound quality is better at this price . One speaker was broken a liitle while shipping .,5
"Using this for the last 3 months.
Sound is good for this price range...
Not expect a big thunder in your room... suitable for having light music and for movies.",5
Nice bass.. sound is good....Where is warrenty card ??,5

"Product is really good and worth for money, only one cons is, when power is switched on, volume sounds high to 45, has to be manually reduced the volume, satellite speakers comes without hook r a whole r a holder, can't hang on wall, provided clamps to do so, other than this, its a nice product",4
"I used and tested it in pc, android, led and also used the FM . Its awsome and bass and treble is nice just need to know the use of Remote. best speaker and quick delivery.",5
It's a good product and the speaker's are suburb sound quality and the bass is ossom,5
"No 1
Connected to my tv, dvd working awesome
Bluetooth connectivity is super
Fm is not so good there is issue with signals
May be they have provided nice arial wire",5
"Superb speaker system,bass is very good.
I bought this for rs2500,worth for the price",5
"Amazing product
I'm using it for 2 years now
It's good for a small crowd or hall.
Amazing bass and everything....",5
The speakers are good ..sound is also enough for the price range...a very good bass is also there.... But sadly there are no holes in the speakers to mount them on wall. The mounting parts are provided in the box but no holes are drilled on the speakers.. So don't expect it's easy to wall mount it. Those who want already drilled holes don't go for this product,4
"Very Cool Product by Zebronics... Brought it @t Great Indian Sale @2300...!!!!

Superb Sound Quality and Bluetooth Connectivity is also Nice...!!!

Thanks Amazon Team for Guaranteed 1 Day Delivery..!!!!",5
"Looking good..
Fast delivery...
bluetooth working fine from my laptop and mobile
fm working good.
i gave only 4 star coz of less bass.
only demerit is less bass...
other than that worth for given money...",4
"These valued speakers are very bang for buck they sound average with most of it taking the bass.
The satellites are a bit non-effective as you can't tell that they are working may be its the content.
They don't have a hole on back to hang them to nail on walls so stuck placing all them side by side infront of me
the sub woofer takes most of content and the satellites just enhance it .
remote control is good. one bad thing is we have to turn on the speakers every time it is switched on with remote or buttons on it to use it.",4
"Very nice bass effect......it's Bluetooth connectivity is awesome,gud product to buy at this price....one little drawback is wires of front speakers is little short!",4
"Good product. Value for money but at full volume speakers crying a bit
Pros:- Bluetooth, 5.1 channels, stylish design, average bass.
Cons:- a bit low on volume but it is great for price, best buy below 3k",4
Very nice product,5
"After using this for one month i am writing this review..
This sound system is a nice one and very much value for 3k.
1.Suitable for 15*20 room and enough loud.
2.able to play FLAC and WAV format(sometimes sucks)
3. Bluetooth connectivity is very good and even plays as the same quality from your phone.
4. Very decent audio if it's a 80s audio..
You can improve the sound by using your phone audio effects or Dolby atmos app while using bt.
So it's worth buying it.",4
"A good 5.1 speaker with woofer with Bluetooth option, performance wise good bass and sound control. I am satisfied",5
Excellent product... Do go for it... Value for money!!,5
"Sound is very clear
Each every instrument is playing well and clearly Bluetooth connection is well",5

Very high price,5
good sound quality and effective outlook but I recognized that there are no effective changes in f&d sound system before products and in this present sound system.at last good product in effective price.,4
Product is good . it's price is high on flipkart.i bought it 4500‚Çπ it is best for this price its have no individual bass control. Bluetooth connection is slow. Over all best for this brice,4
"Sound is clear but bass is just missing a bit . You can feel that the sound from speaker goes high up by the bas has limitations and that somehow makes you feel that is could have been better. Guys if you have small rooms or buying for bedrooms then fine but for a big hall or common area in house then forget it. .

Easy to use product. Very light weight. Looks old fashioned style. But for the budget 4999 is ok to buy this. If you have lower budget then for for the 2.1 Chanel model of t...",4
"GOOD SOUND AND BASS , BUT AUX TO TV NOT GOOD SURROUND WHEN COMPARED TO BLUTOOTH.
GO FOR THIS IF YOU WANT GOOD HT. GOOD PRODUCT",4
"The design of the product is good but as view of safety angle it is not safe as the woofer and speaker are easily in touch and can be easily damaged by rat or children. I think f& d has to consider the safety of that also
Otherwise the product is very good and sound is clear and loud",4
I have been using it for more than 6 months now. It's a beautiful piece of equipment that complements your room. It offers powerful sound with great bass that you can even feel. Sound quality is good. Only slight problem is that the pilot speakers wire attachment with subwoofer sometimes becomes loose. Never used FM but bluetooth and Aux works perfectly fine. Delivery was quick and set was in nice condition. Happy with purchase.,4
"hmm... sound quality, volume loudness and the design are all good, how ever one can enjoy it at its full only when it's connected to a DVD player or blue ray are to some other system which actually supports 5.1 channel sound system...If this home theater is connected through AUX to mobile or smart box it didn't give the complete out put... more over when connect by means of AUX port don't expect the system to be loud... so if you have a complete setup go with this system...otherwise just go f...",4
"One of the best, if not the best, 5.1 speakers in the Budget segment. I got it during sale under 5K which was a steal deal.
Thundering Bass and equally scintillating sounds from the 5 Speakers. Got Remote which can operate from a fair distance as well.
The surround sound works very well if the speakers are placed properly in a spread out way.

it beats the Mi Sound bar, that was recently launched (In terms of Sound & Features & Connectivity )",4
"Nice packing and prompt delivery by flipkart.
product is good, satellite speakers box are made up plastic and effect is not good.
Bass and clarity is Ok",4
"very good boss and sound .perfect for medium size rooms.good product for this price and filpkart delivery is good delivered even remote area before delivery date ,totally worth for money.",4

"Reached before 3 days than the expected date....packing was bad....seller did not give proper importance to the product while it is sent...
Product pack was good....

Bluetooth coverage less than 10 mts...
Cannot play audio via bluetooth from other room properly....",4
happy to have this sound system at home. our hall is 14 by 17 and sound feel good in it. bass is also fine for home use.,4
After 5 day use .good product .fm reciever is good and get clarity .channel speakers are doing good awsome clarity .bass is little bit low .if we placed the sub undrr any table or something will enhance the perfomance and get a louder base .but price is little bit high .alltogather a good experience,4
Nice product.. I like it,4
"I am writing this review after 5 days of using F3800x.
Over all:-
Great deal. I am happy with the purchase. I bought this for 4449 during festive sale. Thanks flipkThe output is good for this price range. The output sound is decent and you can hear even the minute instrumentals sound. Bass is decent. If you are extreme bass lover, then this is not your cup of tea. I was confused with F3800x and sony dav40. This one was under my buget, so i went with F3800x. Good output for good quality songs....",4

If you are looking for a budget multimedia speaker set. Then F&D 3800x is the one which will not disappoint you and give you a beast of sound. It has inbuilt ambient lighting in its subwoofer which will make you jump and dance on the tunes. 5 speakers will give you the filling of sound surround. It's bass is medium. So if you are going for budget speaker set with all advance features than you should just buy it,4

nice,3
I don't like this product. Not comfortable,3
"Here is my opinion.

The upgrade was not as good as expected but still for its price it is quite decent nonetheless.

Made of plastic. The head band is very thin and you might break if you accidentally drop it or put excessive pressure. You have to handle it carefully.

Sound quality and vocals are pretty generic and not better than you get in any 300 to 600 rupee headphones.

Bass is good, it seems to be somewhat pale at 50%, then again if you want to experience great bass you must increase...",3
Good,3
Satisfied with the price and sound quality. If you want headphones for playing PUBG mobile just go for this . This product delivers you the better sounds in this price segment.,3
Super,3
Best quality for money,3
Headphone is good but not anything special they say it's super extraaa bass but it's not bass is kinda underwhelming other than that build quality is good for its price cable is good quality too if you can buy it for under 700 then go for it,3

"I bought this looking at reviews and comments.
First thing negative I seen is not comfortable with ears.
Second is bass is good as every one say but the real bass should be smooth as well as punchy.
Here in this boat bassheads 900 bass is punchy but not smooth. In Sony headsets you will love the bass effect.
Overall, you can listen hearing one or two songs but cannot enjoy using in hours time.",3

"I don't understand the hype behind all these boat headphones. They are nothing special but still people will rate their products 4.3/5 or above as is the case with this. This headphone is very average in terms of overall sound quality. You will not be impressed with it if you've used proper high end companies like JBL, Sennheiser, Sony, etc. The volume of the headphones are just not that loud enough IMO. It's good if you get it for 600-650 but anything more than that is not bang for buck for ...",3

"HONEST REVIEW
*First of all, while using for some time it causes too much pain on my ears. I can't able to use continuously for more than 1 hour.it exert much pressure on ears.
*The build quality and overall design is good.
*comeing to sound quality, it have loud bass. But u wiil loose the sound quality. Sound quality is average and bass is high.",3
"it take to much time. and product is made up purly plastic it bad thing.. i see in thepicture like orignal and brand but not too much strong.. this product.
but good thing is it too much lite. and good base quality.. plz puchess.. for gaming or study",3
Cool,3
Bass is just like phata speaker in one side,3
"Not a good product. If u want a headphone under 1k then go for jbl. This product is not worth of money. We can hear the sound 5m apart from the headphone. It's just only for bass. For playing pubg its not recommended. Overall don't buy this, better go for JBL for this price range.",3
Good,3
Good headset to play pubg,3
To be better,3
Audio and all is good but material is very fragile. The band will break in 2 as soon as you stretch it a bit.,3
"good product , with the good basss",3
Average,3

Let me tell you this are on the ear headphones not over the ear so buy it accordingly .. Sound and bass are perfect üíØüíØ .. And cable is a good one .. Go for it if you have no problem of wire,3
Value for money at this price,3
My favourite quality headphone,3
Good value for price. Voice clarity is ok. Volume is it's strength. Quality of mic is average. One negative aspect is it's clamp which is quite hard & less elastic. Ears end up pushed tightly and hurts within one hour usage.,3
Nice,3
Sounds quality amazing but overpriced,3
sound quality is good i like it,3

Best quality,3
"My review after using for 3 months.:-
Product is good for people who are not going to use it too much. Head hurts if used for more than 2 hours in a day. The size is small and feels very tight on head. For programmers, a big NO, don't go with this. Another reason why I don't like this is because of it's mic. I have to meetings and interviews frequently and the mic is far from mouth. So, I have to constantly hold it close to my mouth, which leaves me with the choice of either talking or coding...",3
Sound quality and Bass is good but it is little bit tight and cause ear pain after using it for a long time.,3
Product is okay for the cost.,3
"Sound, bass and design are good but not comfortable during stuff. It is painful for üëÇ ear may be design issue.",3
bass and sound quality are awesome in this just as the 2000 rs headphones but the only problem is cushion of the headphones which are thin which make it less comfortable,3
Doesn't fit for every head i.e not freesize,3
Not as expected.,3
Wire teared at bend. Inner treads come out.,3
Okay not bad,3
This product is really good you can buy this,3
good product,3
"Average sound quality
Bass is just normal does not justify the name basshead",3
"First of all this is not "" over there head headphone ""but"" on the ear headphone"".dissapointed by Flipkart description of product.

Good product but late delivery.,3
Nice product good,3
"Good ste for rs= 799, its good",3

Please don't buy this product take a better boat bassheads 100 than this,3
"On first use find it quite good,but lookwise it is not attractive.after 2-3 months will add some cons if found.

Edit - So here the review after 2 months,it is working perfectly fine and i got this @769 but if can manage to book this on big billion day sale then this will cost you around 600 bucks.

"1.the design looks good...
2. bass is ok not to loud...
3. started to feel that the wire has got some problem
4. overall ok...",3
Ok for this rate don't expect too much,3
Value for money product but wrost part is that it hurts your ear after using 1 to 2 hours continuesly.,3
Very bad for PUBG....,3
Tbh the product is exactly as it is shown in the pics..... I m in a way or other satisfied with the product.... The sound is little too much on base soo thts a negative aspect of this.... Other than this a great product in this price range... Also its starts buzzing smtimes,3

This headphones is awesome. Unbelievable sound in this price. I am very enjoyed to use this product.,3
Working fine in mobiles. Mic not functioning properly in laptops. Other side people getting very low sound from my end even though all drivers and 100% volume in place. I would suggest worth buying. Build and sound quality is good,3
Not recommended for pubg because voice chat not clear and some weapons sounds are too high,3
One side not working and this happend just within 6 months,3
"Not as expected but does the job
Sound coming become somewhat low
Looks cheap like a cheap chinese earphone of 100-200
Automatically disconnecting from my mobile can't say if the problem lies with mobile or this.
Main thing is bass is very good but do not listen on full volume as it may cause some damage to ears if the song contains high bass.",3
Nice,3
NICE SPEAKER FOR BASS,3

"The headphones are great feel a little warm at first but they are great fit.
But the same issues arise with each and every boat headset
Mic volume gets low over time and one ear cup stops working
Overall the product has great sound and clearity but lacks the shelf life as it stops working within 6 months.",3
Awesome product. Delivery is also good. Thanks ‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è,3
Nice,3
Awesome bass but less comfortable,3
My order was late than the expected date it is a good product super but the body of the headphone is very soft or made of cheap quality it's foldable the problem with this product is that it's build for light usage 1 fall may break it completely considering the price it cost almost 2500 excluding the discount Flipkart provide us I think. U should go for a headphone of JBL brand which is much cheaper and efficient than this,3
Best headphone only some times sound defalt,3

"Pretty good for the price range

These headphones are weirdly balanced, the bass is much concentrated in the right one while treble(vocals) in the left, but you'll feel this difference only if you pay attention, otherwise the sound quality is really good.

Coming to build of the headphones, you'll have to have a really strong upper ear if you're planning to use the product for long durations.

Overall, decent product IDK, buy it if you have no other choice",3
It's good bt not as they show..Bass is low sound is loud..if we think by his price it is best in that price,3

"It has very good sound and bass quality and at a reasonable price it is very good. But the build quality it is not upto the mark, I am using it since 15th july 2019 and the head of the aux cable where spring is attached(the part which we insert in the phone) has the worst design and quality. After frequent use it gets damaged as ut is very vulnerable.",3

sound quality is good,3
Sound is low.. But quite sweet with adequate base,3
just ok,3
Build quality and overall performance is good .The only thing is lacking is comfort .We cannot use this for longer period of time continuesly maybe because of tightness it provides and lack of enough ear cushioning.and one another issue I noted is even a slight touch on the audio jack cause disturbance in sound. I owned a sony headphone of same price range before it was too comfortable but the loudness and bass not near to this one provides.,3
"good sound, poor bass, not up to mark, bought it for 700... good for money...",3

I suggest not to buy and if you're ready to buy then you need to keep your ear hard an iron.,3
not that good as advertised,3
"For first few days you will have good bass experience, but slowly slowly the bass gets degrading and the sound quality seems like to be distorted. Better look for some other models or brands.",3

The headphone were good but after 3 months of use the cable end just bent after use.. Not so durable as it shows.. But the sound quality is good for sure... Be careful when using,3

"These headphones are pretty small in size. So for a person with a big head these will definitely be uncomfortable. Having said that they are absolutely value for money.
The bass is punchy. So if you are into electronic music these are perfect for you.
But I noticed that these headphones tries to put bass into almost everything. So when I was using these on a call, the person voice wasn't clear enough and was bassy...
Also if you listen vocals on these, it wont be great.
So as the name has bas...",4
"Awesome bass sound ,,,
Feel like satisfies when hear the clarity music",4

"These headphones are worth money.They have a descent bass and a sound quality.The foldable design is unique and helpful.But needs improvement in comfort
and noise cancellation.overall the product is value for money and i would like to recommend it",4
"headphone is great but you can never satisfy any customer.
Sound is great but so loud that a person standing at a distance of 5 metre can also listen it. But it is good product specially for those who want to show offüòÇ in public and disturb others in silence.",4

"this headphone is excellent, the best headphone at this price super bass, super sound quality but I am giving 4star just because it's built and design otherwise it's a brilliant product. I can give you gurantee",4
"Overall nice product & perfect for the price
Pros- sound quality is pretty good & bass is average which is good for a music lover(if you're not into bass)
Cons- the wires they are a bit annoying and long
In terms of built the foldable parts( one of those aren't that smooth)
Sometimes it feels as if both the earcups differ in volume",4
"If you're a bass lover go for it , nice while playing game , Pubg and all , neat sound",4
Good sound and good bass..a good choice in this price range.Though i am not sure about its longilivity...but i am quite satisfied with its initial performance...,4
"its a decent headphone got in 749.

The ear pads are not that comfortable as they feel very tight on the ears. But the sound quality is very very good and it sometimes feels like the sound is actually coming from outside which feels amzing.,4
"Cushioning is good but makes the ears to sweat soon enough (may be 40-60mins)
sound quality though is good for the price
size of the clip is adjustable and i think should fit most (usless u r an extreme)?",4

"This head-over headphone is good for listening music. Its BASS is powerful. It has a built-in microphone that works well.

"Sound quality is very good and clear.
Bass is also good for low and medium quality songs, but when playing hd music it gets noisy because of bass and vibrations result into ""burrpppp"" kind if sounds like two plastics make when they vibrate in contact.
That's why i have reduced it to 4 star.
For standard quality music its very good at this price point.

Build quality is fine.
Ear pads are comfortable.
Adjustable to your fit.
Best thing is that it's foldable that's why I purchased it for travel...",4

"It is totally worth your purchase if you are getting it under 1000k. Sound quality is not the best but it is really good for normal users as well as for bass lovers. The design and built quality is also good. This headphone is foldable and the end part of connecting wire is made of metal with a spring like design that makes it very flexible and robust.

It has in line mic and noise cancellation that works well. It performs smoothly in mobile, laptop and PC without any hassle. Personally the o...",4
"The product is really good
Look wise not so good as compare to sound quality the bass is also too good

It's good clear sound & bass. but only thing is sound going outside. and fully made with plastics .overall it's a good one for mid range user's,4
"I loved this product, truly loved it.The packaging was good and the product is best at this price. Good sound quality is the highlight. One thing that prompts me not to give 5 stars is that the sound levels even at the lowest volumes causes irritation. Don't know why this is happening.",4
"VALUE FOR MONEY!!!
One of the best headphones you can get for this price range!!!!
Sounds are crisp and clear and are also comfortable for long time!!!",4

product quality is good not best sound quality very good. the price Rs.799 is 30% high .... dilevery was nice thanks flipkart,4
"First of all, superb bass with comfortable loudness. Built quality is good.Ear padding is adequate. It's not a bluetooth headphone so it's doesn't has any battery. But traveling or jogging with this headphone is uncomfortable. Overall it's a good product in this price range",4
Best price best quality nice mic super discount üëç thank to filpkart ...üëåüëåüëåüëåüëå,4

"For the price range this is a good buy....
The built quality is not that good as higher versions which gives lesser comfort ....",4
Build quality is pretty good for the price. But sound is just okay. Nothing out of the world. Noise cancelling mic is awesome. Has a nice metalic connector with a spring to protect from wear and tear. Time will tell if it can withstand daily wear and tear.,4
"For this price range, so far the best in OH category.
Better sound quality and not too bassy.
Sounds more in between flat and bass, and its good.
Also, i brought the white one and it looks very promising and feels good.

Oh, and the spring work on the jack though..it really helps üëå

boAt ‚ù§Ô∏è",4
A pretty good pair of headsets. Only make sure the audio jack fits properly with your device. The jack might be slightly shaky with older devices. Fits well into my laptop and cell phones. But a little shaky on another old phone of mine. Sound quality and bass are wonderful.,4
"Although sound quality is awesome and stunning..
it creates vacuum like situation on earlobes and it makes ears sweat..
But Thumping bass makes it worth !!",4
"bass is good but music quality not too good and this is very uncomfortable
you can't use this for long time",4
Sound and build quality is pretty good but its little small as compared to other headphones but I can say it is best in this budget,4

nice best price headphone and best bass all clear sound bass is also best üëçüíØ,4
nice headset n budget friendly too... one who wants good headset in minimum budget I would recommend this..,4
"Sound quality is superb .. Bass is at a perfect level where we can enjoy the music and the vocals are crystal clear .. Only problem is that its on the ears not over the ears , therefore ears starts to pain after 1 to 2 hrs of use.",4
"Nice product. It actually have a good quality bass which they claims. And also the bass does not disturbs the mid tones and high tones. Feels very light while wearing. If you are a music lover,you can go for this. And also for PUBG it is good,but not that good. The sounds are good enough but i don't recommend this only for playing PUBG. Overall it does not let let your wishes down.",4
"The audio quality of the headset is top notch. But the mic is really poor, I first returned the headset which i got because the mic was full of noices. And even the piece i got returned from the company was not of the great quality. It was a bit better than the first mic. Thats it. If your purpose is just listening to music, and if you are a music lover, just go for it. It is the best headset available in this price range. Be immersed in the bass of every music.",4
Good quality headphones. The sounds are crisp and clear. Produce a comfortable bass. A good competitor to my senheisser earphones.,4
Good sound quality and bass is also good build quality is good but design should be more effective,4
"4* only because of bad package handling...

Good headphone for price of 750.
Sound quality and bass is good, I mean what more you can ask for 750.

Mic is also pretty good, maybe it records at lower volume.
Also mic is pretty close to ear, I would've prefer 4-5 inch more below current position. Simple reason for current position if you don't lift it voice will be too low and if you lift it you'll find you are tugging on headphone.

This product is on-the-ear one not over-the-ear one.",4
"The cushion of this headphone is like a premier headphone feels like ‚Çπ2000 headphone. And the bass is superb. Only thing is while I wear for more than 30 min, it gets pain in my ear. Other than this its a best buy at this price point and if you love bass just go for it.",4
the edge at the joint is quite bit sharp and despite all things are so good at this price range it's best,4
nice product it maintain good sound quality and its feel like premium only bass is average and one more thing i recomend black colour or other please dont go with white colour because it full dirty with only one day use,4
"Bought this product a week ago. Been really good to me.
Pros:

- Cheap: Got it for 899/-
- Very nicely built: I paid 2199 for a SkullCandy headphones and it was plastic. This is also plastic but it's heavy and well constructed.
Makes you think you've bought a premium set of heads. The connector pin is also very well built and is pretty heavy and firm.
- ExtraaaaBass: Has above moderate levels of bass.
- Extremely Loud*: This thing is LOUD. I ended up using most of it at 50% volume. It rea...",4
hello guys ..this boat.heades is good and giving good output to ur music experience and ...this made by the finest fetherd quality and ..its good and fine...,4
To cool product. Rich in bass. Finishing is awesome. No sharp edges except for very few places. The cancellation is moderate. But must but for bass listeners.,4
"It's an amazing product..no complain about anything like bass and stuff. But it doesn't have proper noise cancellation, like if you listen any song on full volume in an empty room like library, others can hear it too and your seat mate can definitely hear it.",4
"Amazing beats and Superb bass, Need to compromise on build quality a very little bit. otherwise it is one of the best headphone under this price.",4
"i have been using it since 2 weeks now bass is awesome but vibrates a lot when at full volume which is something personally i don't like much.
Another thing that made me Feel bad about it was while listening to music others may not be able to hear whatever you are listening but While making calls the conversation of other person is easily audible to anyone which sucks trust me so out of 10 i will give it 6.5 and the Rest 3.5 has been deducted because of that calling voice audible to others o...",4

"As per music view, i find this product very good, the only flaw i found out is u will not feel comfort if u use it for longer time. Like if u use it for half an hour u will start getting frustrated as it is little tight for some people. At last, everything about sound quality is awesome, u just have to compromise with comfortness. Thats all i m giving 4 stars for this ;)",4

Both the sides have stopped working.
(edit):
the product's customer service is great.
They took my headphone for service and replaced instead of the other one.(It was still covered in warranty)",4
"Bass is good.really good.
sound quality is bit cheap compared to other headsets may be because of bass domination.
look is good.
I liked the 3.5mm jack.
build quality seems to be good.
after few hours you LL get pain.

totally.. it's satisfying.
not disappointed.",4
all over awesome,4

'Wire is too much long, extermy good'
'Sound is great, in this price. 749/-'",4

it was very tight....
designing was not good...

it was very tight so I was placed with book about 15hrs to make it free from tight as shown in the image",4
Upon first using the headphones I was disappointed. But then I configured the equalizer and so I can now say that hype around these headphones are real. These came with extra bass so I lowered the bass a little bit which made them so beautiful and soothing to listen. Remember guys each headphones is like a machine in itself and you should sometimes configure them so as to get the maximum output from them.,4

The sound quality is excellent. Bass lovers will certainly like it. Sometimes I feel that the bass overpowers the highs. Build quality is excellent. Right now it's very tight and I can't wear it for long hours.,4
Good enough as a budget headphone. Working properly. One can go for it without any hesitation. Use Poweramp music player for best music experience... Quite painful for ear for a long term usage...,4
fabluse product,4
"Quite Satisfactory

After using this product for 2 - 3 days, I can confirm that you won't regret choosing boAt. The headphones look appealing at the exterior while providing a compact foldable design. While the noise cancellation feature is another highlight at this nominal price, the headphones do deliver the bass as promised. The cushioning on the headphones is just right for prolonged usage as well. I have used these headphones for watching movies and listening to music for 3 hours at a st...",4
"Good, bass is average",4
"About product:
For this price range, it is a good product.
I feel the microphone should have been a bit more towards down side than where it is currently placed.
This causes microphone to brush against your neck/beard if you don't hold it away from your face.
I purchased this for work from home because I've to attend many calls. If I let the microphone wire hang as is, it produces friction noise to other participants just because mic is placed a bit on the upper side.
About delivery:
Thanks ...",4

"sound quality is good. bass is also good.

Actually it's a nice headphone in this price range . But sound leaking is the main problem . If you can afford sound leaking then you can buy this otherwise spend some more money to buy a better one. And you won't get a better product within this price.,4
Amazing product and come up with the really nice bass quality but not happy with the delivery because it's too late..,4
for this price it was good product. and flipkart was cheating us by redeeming super points instead of Discount. in other sites we can see the real price comparison,4

"I got the headphones for just 899, and the quality of the sound is very decent , and I can say that it is worth every penny. Looks like the headphone is gonna survive at least 1 year. Cons. White colour gets dirty easily.",4
"I purchased it because of the low price and average reviews on many online shops. So it's OK if we consider the price tag. However it's sound is clearly audible outside, so much so that even if it's lying on the table, you can listen to the entire song clearly. That's annoying. No privacy.",4

Very bad quality, lose one side. One side is not working after 2 months.

If you like listening music you will be very disappointed. Even an earphone that comes free with phone are better than this.
It's a base edition without base. I don't know if the people who have given it 5 star are deaf or what. Previously I had Jabra elite 25e and these earphones are not working even 10% of that.

Calling with my bullets z bass edition connected via bluetooth cause a buzzing noise which can be heard by the other person. This goes away if I switch to phone or speaker mode so its obviously an earphone or bluetooth issue. Also I cannot hear the noise but the person on the other end of the call hears it. This dosen't happen while listening to music. Resetting the earphones sometimes works for sometime but then the issue occurs randomly again.",1

If you like listening music you will be very disappointed. Even an earphone that comes free with phone are better than this.
It's a base edition without base. I don't know if the people who have given it 5 star are deaf or what. Previously I had Jabra elite 25e and these earphones are not working even 10% of that.
At full volume it has no music but distortion.
The fit in the ear is re...",1
Dont buy ...I recommend oppo enco m31 it has more useful features tban this stupid oneplus..my brother bought oppo enco m31.....and its way more useful and better than this...,1
"All reviews are accurate but i can't understand why all users gave good reviews about its battery life, i have used various earphones in past such as boat, real me, oppo, mivi, all the earphones have very decent even greater battery life to what they claim but seriously guys this earphone have very very poor battry backup compared to other brands earphones,
Except battry life all the features are good of this earphone, choose wisely",1
"Do not buy
Calling with my bullets z bass edition connected via bluetooth cause a buzzing noise which can be heard by the other person. This goes away if I switch to phone or speaker mode so its obviously an earphone or bluetooth issue. Also I cannot hear the noise but the person on the other end of the call hears it. This dosen't happen while listening to music. Resetting the earphones sometimes works for sometime but then the issue occurs randomly again.",1

First thing to look after when we have earphones like these is battery and it these r fentastic charge for 10mits and it serves you a whole day and even more too.

Sound clarity is too good in comparison of realme wireless and also bass is far better from realme wireless.bass is reaching in the core.,5
I have used a lot of Bluetooth neckband earphones but after using OnePlus Bullets Z Bass Edition for a while now I can surely say that these are the best neckband earphones below 2000 rupees.

"ONEPLUS has done an excellent job.
exceptional earphone with EXCELLENT SOUND QUALITY, EXCELLENT BASS, EXCELLENT CALL QUALITY & EXCELLENT COMFORT...
The final thing is battery... It's excellent in my words.I got more than 12 hours of battery backup throughout 3 days with more than 6 hours of calling. One more additional thing is that it can be charged within 50 minutes to 100% and 10 minutes of charging gives more than 60% of charge.

NO WORDS..absolutely wonderful about the sound quality and vocal toning..bass is perfect all that you need..Has been using for a month now and it is working perfectly well.

Sound quality is decent bass is below average you don't expect bass like headphone. Best part about your earphone fast charging and battery backup just 15 minute charge and you're good to go for 10 to 12 hours,5
OnePlus Bullets Z Bass Edition is the best bluetooth Neckband earphones I have used ever. They are of very high quality and sound output is also very very rich and clear.

Super satisfied with this purchase.,5
"Good sound effect

Battery backup is good. Charging speed also very fast. Not best but good sound quality. Worth for price. I am enjoying the product,5
"Actually this is the earphones that once I dreamt of. Now I got this and I am really really was excited about this.The sound quality is so far the best in the segment and the reengineered bass is so sick.The battery pack up has no issues cause it supports warp charging, so 10 minutes is crazy fast. And the built quality has been always better with one plus.So I am fully satisfied",5
After comparison with all neckband I bought this. It was great experience with oneplus. Bass is awesome. You need not to make full volume for deep bass. It shows it‚Äôs class with smaller volume also. Easy pairing. Easy play pause.,5

Very comfortable.Design is good but I was a bit unsatisfied with the position of the control part but after some use I became used to that. Bass is more than that of it's previous version but not like in a wired headset. 8hr continuous working after full charge and taking 40min to full charge after complete discharge.,5
Bass is really awesome n heavy which obviously it's point of selling....this can handle higher bass songs without any tearing up of sound.... battery would have been much better....they claim 17 hrs battery backup but practically it lasts 12-13 hrs .....would recommend everyone to burn these for 2-3 hrs before putting it on...... rating 4/5.,5

Giving this review after using 3 months.

Battery üîã is amazingly long lasts for atleast 2 days with almost 10 hrs of heavy usage. I usually charge it for just 5 minutes and 1 days full use is enough.

Music üéµ is also power-packed. With this price range i quite shocked first that one plus can give this type of sound. Usually i found this type of sound and clearity in higher range with premium brands like Audio technica, AKG, Marshalls and B&O's ...",5

If you want to know the number of steps walked in a day, one has to see it before sleeping at night otherwise, it cannot be known next day. similarly for the week, you have to see it on Saturday night before sleeping, otherwise no previous data is available.",1

"It has too many bugs in this watch and also noise application. Go and check the rating of the application.
Sometimes it shows the contact name and sometimes not.

Hope all are doing good in the pandemic situations.

1st I like to thank to the Flipkart and the vendor to deliver the product on time.
I have rated it as 3 but it deserve more like 3.6 or 4.
Watch is totally worth at the price of Big billion day sale.
Built quality of frame band lock and display case is very good.
All over watch is very light and I m happy to wear it, as promised all the features are working fine as mentioned,

But the only CON is ...",3
"Seems value for a money deal for me as I got the same for less than 2400. However, there are some lagging issues but surely you can't compare oranges with apple (LOL).

Build quality is superb, looks are good.

Overall I am satisfied.",3

Nothing special,3
Nice,3
Not worth 3.5k money we spend on this watch. Got fooled.,3
"Watch is just ok ok, not too much impressive.",3
"I expected a little more out of it... Let me tell you why...
1. A very limited number of watch faces (biggest drawback)
2. Screen resolution below expectation
3. Screen wakes up after 2 sec of wrist movement
4. Small display size",3
"This product is not as smart as expected. It doesn't capture accurate/correct steps while working out on a trademill. Calories burnt while doing Yoga is captured in two different ways - while the yoga mode is on, it reflects different readings and while you are doing yoga in normal mode, it reflects a different reading with less calories burnt as compared to 'Yoga Mode On'
I think one should buy a better smartwatch at this price instead of Noise ColorFit Pro 2.",3
